Cancer survivorship care plans (SCPs) are critical tools for guiding long-term follow-up care of cancer survivors. Yet, their widespread adoption remains hindered by the significant clinician burden and the time- and labor-intensive process of SCP creation. Current practices require clinicians to extract and synthesize treatment summaries from complex patient data, apply relevant survivorship guidelines, and generate a care plan with personalized recommendations, making SCP generation time-consuming. In this study, we systematically explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automating SCP generation and introduce Survivorship Navigator, a framework designed to streamline SCP creation and enhance integration with clinical systems. We evaluate our approach through automated assessments and a human expert study, demonstrating that Survivorship Navigator outperforms baseline methods, producing SCPs that are more accurate, guideline-compliant, and actionable.
