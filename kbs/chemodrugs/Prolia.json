{"drug_name": "Prolia", "description": "\nDENOSUMAB (den oh SUE mab) prevents weakened bones caused by cancer. It may also be used to treat noncancerous bone tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. It can also be used to treat high calcium levels in the blood caused by cancer. It works by blocking a protein that causes bones to break down quickly. This slows down the release of calcium from bones, which lowers calcium levels in your blood.
