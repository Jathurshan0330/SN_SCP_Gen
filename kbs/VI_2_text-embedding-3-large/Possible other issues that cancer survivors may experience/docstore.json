The potential for neurotoxicities, such as\npersistent mental clouding, increased risk of falls in the elderly, and\nother phenomena may occur. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia is well\ndescribed in preclinical models but has uncertain clinical im-\nportance; the potential is considered when a patient reports es-\ncalating pain in tandem with opioid dose escalation in the absence\nof identi\ufb01able worsening of a pain cause. A more recent line of\ninquiry is the effect of opioids on immune function and tu-\nmor progression, and ultimately, survival. Preclinical studies\nimplicate m opioids in tumor progression,101 although studies\nin humans are lacking. Clearly, there is an urgent need for\nadditional research.\nOpioid-related harm may also result from misuse or abuse,\nthe development of opioid addiction, or the occurrence of drug\ndiversion within the community. The problem of prescription drug\nabuse is serious,102 leading to an increase in opioid-related deaths,\nbut mitigation efforts designed to assess, stratify, and limit risk can\nenhance safety for patients, prescribers, and the community.

Barriers to implementation include the need to increase\nawareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line\npractitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to\nprovide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The\nguideline Bottom Line Box (Table 1) was designed to facilitate the\nimplementation of recommendations.

Therefore, in\nconsideration of recommended care for the target index condition,\nclinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in the\npatient and take those conditions into account when formulating\nthe treatment and follow-up plan.\nIn light of these considerations, practice guidelines should\nprovide information on how to apply the recommendations for\npatients with MCCs, perhaps as a qualifying statement for rec-\nommended care. This may mean that some or all of the recom-\nmended care options are modi\ufb01ed or not applied, as determined by\nbest practice in consideration of any MCCs.\nEXTERNAL REVIEW\nAfter \ufb01nalization by the workgroup, the guideline was sent to addi-\ntional internal experts (ACS and ASCO) and external experts for review\nand comment before submission for publication. Review comments\nwere reviewed by the expert panel and integrated into the \ufb01nal article\nbefore approval by the Clinical Practice Guideline Committee.\nGUIDELINE IMPLEMENTATION\nACS/ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across health\nsettings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase\nawareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line\npractitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to\nprovide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The\nguideline Bottom Line Box (Table 1) was designed to facilitate the\nimplementation of recommendations.

These factors are\nespecially relevant when developing population-based guidelines\nthat call for advanced diagnostic technologies or subspecialty care\nthat may not be readily available across all centers.

From the patient\u2019s perspective, additional\nhurdles emerge. During brief health consultations, the pri-\nority often centers on cancer control, leaving limited room\nfor comprehensive fatigue discussions.198 Patients may lack\nthe stamina for extended visits solely dedicated to fatigue\nmanagement. Furthermore, health care practitioners\u2019 atti-\ntudes toward fatigue\u2014whether dismissive or empathetic\u2014\nshape patient experiences and willingness to engage in\ndialogue.197-199 When patients speak, all too often, clinicians\ninterrupt them after only a few seconds.200\nTo bridge these gaps, fostering open communication be-\ncomes paramount. Patients should be encouraged to artic-\nulate their fatigue symptoms, describing severity, temporal\npatterns, and the impact on daily life.

However, recent studies have highlighted\ncritical gaps in patient-physician interactions regarding\nCRF.197-199 Contrary to guideline recommendations, a sig-\nni\ufb01cant proportion of physicians fail to address CRF ade-\nquately.198 Barriers include insuf\ufb01cient knowledge, time\nconstraints, and a lack of accessible screening tools or clear\nreferral pathways. From the patient\u2019s perspective, additional\nhurdles emerge. During brief health consultations, the pri-\nority often centers on cancer control, leaving limited room\nfor comprehensive fatigue discussions.198 Patients may lack\nthe stamina for extended visits solely dedicated to fatigue\nmanagement. Furthermore, health care practitioners\u2019 atti-\ntudes toward fatigue\u2014whether dismissive or empathetic\u2014\nshape patient experiences and willingness to engage in\ndialogue.197-199 When patients speak, all too often, clinicians\ninterrupt them after only a few seconds.200\nTo bridge these gaps, fostering open communication be-\ncomes paramount. Patients should be encouraged to artic-\nulate their fatigue symptoms, describing severity, temporal\npatterns, and the impact on daily life. Active listening by\nclinicians allows tailoring of interventions to individual\nneeds. Emphasizing shared decision making and realistic\nexpectations\u2014coupled\nwith\nongoing\ncommunication\u2014\nforms the bedrock of effective CRF management. It is\nnoteworthy to highlight the potential risk within certain\ncultures or among individuals who may refrain from dis-\nclosing\nalternative\ninterventions\nused\nto\nmanage\nCRF\nsymptoms, such as herbal remedies, cannabis, or prayer,\nbecause of apprehension about potential criticism or judg-\nment from health care providers, which could adversely\naffect treatment outcomes or healing processes."}, "hash": "e21cd42052ea23d92dc7e7e1048398a715b75b682e0bdbd93fa261b69eb8724b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Cancer survivors may experience communication gaps with clinicians regarding cancer-related fatigue (CRF).

Clinicians should conduct an initial\ncomprehensive pain assessment. This assessment should include\nan in-depth interview that explores the multidimensional nature of\nthe pain (pain descriptors, associated distress, functional impact,\nand related physical, psychological, social, and spiritual factors) and\ncaptures information about cancer treatment history and comorbid\nconditions, psychosocial and psychiatric history (including substance\nuse), and prior treatments for the pain. The assessment should\ncharacterize the pain, clarify its cause, and make inferences about\npathophysiology.

Of course, this is good news,\nbut it sometimes comes at a cost. Put simply, chronic pain from\ntreatment-related adverse effects can signi\ufb01cantly affect the quality\nof life of many cancer survivors for years after initial treatment\nstops. Chronic pain can develop from a variety of sources: pe-\nripheral neuropathy, muscle or bone pain, surgery, radiation, and\nother conditions. Comorbidity with other conditions or syn-\ndromes can make assessing chronic pain more dif\ufb01cult. Because\npost-treatment pain is so complicated, good communication be-\ntween patients and their medical providers is essential. Cancer\nsurvivors are more than their cancer history or their pain; they are\nindividuals with unique needs. They may have varying capacities to\ndeal with a great deal of information that can sometimes be\noverwhelming. Just as no two cancers are alike, patients experience\npain differently. Some patients may even be reluctant to discuss\ntheir pain, seeing it as a sign of weakness or fearing a recurrence;\nsome may see it an expected and untreatable complication of their\ncancer treatment. That is why a pain assessment is recommended at\nevery visit. In teasing out how they are coping, clinicians need to\nask patients how chronic pain is affecting them and suggest how\nthey can work together to better manage their symptoms and\nimprove their quality of life. Survivors who understand all aspects\nof their pain treatment plan (and their role in it) may have a better\noverall outcome.\nHealth Disparities\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert\nrecommendations on best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to health care.

Substance-use disorder is a diagnostic term in the \ufb01fth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (Fifth Edition) referring to recurrent use of alcohol or other drugs that causes clinically and functionally signi\ufb01cant\nimpairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. Depending on\nthe level of severity, this disorder is classi\ufb01ed as mild, moderate, or severe.1\nAddiction. Addiction is a term used to indicate the most severe, chronic stage of substance-use disorder, in which there is\na substantial loss of self-control, as indicated by compulsive drug taking despite the desire to stop taking the drug. In the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition), the term addiction is synonymous with the classi\ufb01cation of severe\nsubstance-use disorder (Volkow ND, et al: N Engl J Med 374:363-371, 2016).\nDrug Diversion. Drug diversion is best de\ufb01ned as the diversion of licit drugs for illicit purposes. It involves the diversion of\ndrugs from legal and medically necessary uses towards uses that are illegal and typically not medically authorized or necessary\n(http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Diversion#sthash.2XMd9w6p.dpuf).\nStandard of Care\n1. A diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical cir-\ncumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer is \u201ca new standard of care, but not necessarily the only standard of care.\u201d\n(Volkow ND et al: N Engl J Med 374:363-371, 2016).\n2.

A systematic review of evidence\npublished from 2013-2021 was conducted.\nRESULTS The evidence base consisted of 17 systematic reviews 6 meta analyses (nine for psychosocial in-\nterventions, four for physical exercise, three for mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR], and one for\npharmacologic interventions), and an additional 44 randomized controlled trials. Psychological, educational,\nand psychosocial interventions led to improvements in depression and anxiety. Evidence for pharmacologic\nmanagement of depression and anxiety in cancer survivors was inconsistent. The lack of inclusion of survivors\nfrom minoritized groups was noted and identi\ufb01ed as an important consideration to provide high-quality care for\nethnic minority populations.\nRECOMMENDATIONS It is recommended to use a stepped-care model, that is, provide the most effective and\nleast resource-intensive intervention based on symptom severity. All oncology patients should be offered\neducation regarding depression and anxiety. For patients with moderate symptoms of depression, clinicians\nshould offer cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), behavioral activation (BA), MBSR, structured physical activity, or\nempirically supported psychosocial interventions. For patients with moderate symptoms of anxiety, clinicians\nshould offer CBT, BA, structured physical activity, acceptance and commitment therapy, or psychosocial\ninterventions. For patients with severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, clinicians should offer cognitive\ntherapy, BA, CBT, MBSR, or interpersonal therapy."}}, "ccad764b-30db-4744-b02c-085b2a125a89": {"node_ids": ["68d34802-e702-4326-900d-89d34bd1b9f7"], "metadata": {"page_number": 1, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["ASCO guidelines", "survivorship care", "resources"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "For patients with severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, clinicians should offer cognitive\ntherapy, BA, CBT, MBSR, or interpersonal therapy.

In\nthe short term, stress covaries with depressive and anxiety\nsymptoms, negative quality of life, physical symptoms, and\ntreatment morbidities across patients,10-12 and in the long\nterm, data show its relationship to cancer mortality.13\nThe most common depressive disorders among patients\nwith cancer are major depression and adjustment disorder,\nwith data for other depressive disorders scarce. Depression\nis often accompanied by functional impairment, poorer\nphysical health, substance use, and low quality of life,\nin\ufb02uenced in turn by impaired relationships, reduced\nphysical activity (PA), and other factors.

The one noninferiority trial comparing internet-delivered\nCBT without coaching versus with coaching75 showed no\nsigni\ufb01cant differences and improvements occurred for both\ngroups, contrasting with meta-analyses showing stronger post-\ntreatment effects when coaching is used.132\nThree RCTs were conducted in palliative care settings or with\npalliative care specialists.

In RCTs, screening of\npatients is essential (used in only one third of studies) and\nhas the potential bene\ufb01t of reducing sample size. Regarding\nthe latter, many studies (one third) began with baseline\ngroup differences, a circumstance less likely when ran-\ndomizing within strata, as variables potentially correlated with\nthe outcome can reduce nuisance subject variance. Other\ndecisions can reduce statistical power, such as small sample\nsizes in general, sizes insuf\ufb01cient to detect effects between\nactive treatments, or when any sample size is reduced across\ntime. Data loss threatens the reliability and validity of \ufb01nd-\nings.

ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO website\nand most often published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\nASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform\nmedical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all\npatients should have the opportunity to participate.\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nMore information, including a supplement with additional\nevidence tables, slide sets, and clinical tools and resources,\nis available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines. Pa-\ntient information is available at www.cancer.net.\nGENDER-INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE\nASCO is committed to promoting the health and well-being\nof individuals regardless of sexual orientation or gender\nidentity.164 Transgender and nonbinary people, in partic-\nular, may face multiple barriers to oncology care including\nstigmatization, invisibility, and exclusiveness. One way\nexclusiveness or lack of accessibility may be communi-\ncated is through gendered language that makes pre-\nsumptive links between gender and anatomy.172-175 With\nthe acknowledgment that ASCO guidelines may impact the\nlanguage used in clinical and research settings, ASCO is\ncommitted to creating gender-inclusive guidelines. For this\nreason, guideline authors use gender-inclusive language\nwhenever possible throughout the guidelines. In instances\nin which the guideline draws upon data based on gendered\nresearch (eg, studies regarding women with ovarian can-\ncer), the guideline authors describe the characteristics and\nresults of the research as reported.\nRELATED ASCO GUIDELINES\n\u2022 Screening, Assessment, and Care of Anxiety and\nDepressive Symptoms in Adults with Cancer7\n(https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/jco.2013."}}, "1a732e36-a5a5-4756-9403-fe0606398428": {"node_ids": ["cd62b4f5-b7d9-41af-bb53-7153aef97523"], "metadata": {"page_number": 22, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["anxiety", "depression", "mental health", "cancer survivors"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "52.4611)\n\u2022 Exercise, Diet, and Weight Management during\nCancer Treatment165 (https://ascopubs.org/doi/\n10.1200/JCO.22.00687)\n\u2022 Screening, Assessment, and Management of\nFatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer166 (https://\nascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/jco.2013.53.4495)\n\u2022 Integrative Medicine for Pain Management in\nOncology167 (https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/\nJCO.22.01357)\n\u2022 Management of Chronic Pain in Survivors of\nAdult Cancers168 (https://ascopubs.org/doi/\n10.1200/JCO.2016.68.5206)\n\u2022 Interventions to Address Sexual Problems in People\nWith Cancer169 (https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/\nJCO.2017.75.8995)\n\u2022 Integration of Palliative Care into Standard On-\ncology Care170 (http://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/\nJCO.2016.70.1474)\n\u2022 Patient-Clinician Communication171 (http://\nascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2017.75.2311)\nJournal of Clinical Oncology\n3447\nAnxiety and Depression in Adult Cancer Survivors\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 68.180.32.21 on October 2, 2024 from 068.180.032.021\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Recommendations on Screening and Assessment of Depression and Anxiety\nRecommendation\nScreening for depressive symptoms\nAll patients should be screened for depressive symptoms at their initial visit, at appropriate intervals, and as clinically indicated, especially with changes\nin disease or treatment status (ie, post-treatment, recurrence, progression) and transition to palliative and end-of-life care.\nThe CAPO and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (the Partnership) guideline Assessment of Psychosocial Health Care Needs of the Adult\nCancer Patient suggests screening at initial diagnosis, start of treatment, regular intervals during treatment, end of treatment, post-treatment or at\ntransition to survivorship, at recurrence or progression, advanced disease, when dying, and during times of personal transition or reappraisal such\nas family crisis, during post-treatment survivorship, and when approaching death.a\nScreening should be done using a valid and reliable measure that features reportable scores (dimensions) that are clinically meaningful (established\ncutoffs).a\nWhen assessing a person who may have depressive symptoms, a phased screening and assessment is recommended that does not rely simply on a\nsymptom count.\nAs a \ufb01rst step for all patients, identi\ufb01cation of the presence or absence of pertinent history or risk factors (see Depression Algorithm, Fig 1) is important\nfor subsequent assessment and treatment decision making.\nAs a second step, two items from the PHQ-9 can be used to assess for the classic depressive symptoms of low mood and anhedonia. For individuals\nendorsing either item (or both) as occurring for more than half of the time or nearly every day within the last two weeks (ie, a score of . 2), a third\nstep is suggested in which the patient completes the remaining items of the PHQ-9. It is estimated that 25%-30% of patients would need to\ncomplete the remaining items.\nThe traditional cutoff for the PHQ-9 is . 10. The Panel\u2019s recommended cutoff score of . 8 is based on a study of the diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ-\n9 with cancer outpatients. A meta-analysis by Manea et al also supports the . 8 cutoff score.\nFor patients completing the latter step, it is important to determine the associated sociodemographic, psychiatric or health comorbidities, or social\nimpairments, if any, and the duration that depressive symptoms have been present."}}, "c53ee0f4-2d94-4b89-b924-cf0ccbbe2369": {"node_ids": ["3a9933a3-576a-4675-8dca-9c58fff46c57"], "metadata": {"page_number": 30, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["depression", "self-harm", "culturally sensitive assessments", "learning disabilities", "cognitive impairments", "older adults", "mental health referral"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "Of special note, one of remaining seven items of the PHQ-9 assesses thoughts of self-harm, ie, thoughts that you would be better off dead or hurting\nyourself in some way. Among patients with moderate to severe or severe depression, such thoughts are not rare. Having noted that, it is the\nfrequency and/or speci\ufb01city of the thoughts that are most important vis-`\na-vis risk. Some clinicians/practices may choose to omit the item from the\nPHQ-9 and administer 8 items. It should be noted, however, that doing so may arti\ufb01cially lower the score, with the risk of some patients appearing to\nhave fewer symptoms than they actually do. Such changes also weaken the predictive validity of the score and the clarity of the cutoff scores. It is\nimportant to note that individuals do not typically endorse a self-harm item exclusively or independent of other symptom; rather, it occurs with\nseveral other symptom endorsements. Thus, it is the patient\u2019s endorsement of multiple symptoms that will de\ufb01ne the need for services for moderate/\nsevere to severe symptomatology.\nConsider special circumstances in the assessment of depressive symptoms. These include but are not limited to the following: (1) Use culturally sensitive\nassessments and treatments as is possible, (2) tailor assessment or treatment for those with learning disabilities or cognitive impairments, and (3) be\naware of the dif\ufb01culty of detecting depression in the older adult.\nAssessment of depressive symptoms\nSpeci\ufb01c concerns such as risk of harm to self and/or others, severe depression or agitation, or the presence of psychosis or confusion (delirium) require\nimmediate referral to a psychiatrist, psychologist, physician, or equivalently trained professional.\nAssessments should be a shared responsibility of the clinical team, with designation of those who are expected to conduct assessments as per scope of\npractice.a\nThe assessment should identify signs and symptoms of depression, the severity of cancer symptoms (eg, fatigue), possible stressors, risk factors, and\ntimes of vulnerability.

The pathognomic GAD symptom, ie, multiple excessive worries, may\npresent as concerns or fears. Whereas cancer worries may be common for many, GAD worry or fear may be disproportionate to actual cancer-related\nrisk (eg, excessive fear of recurrence, worry about multiple symptoms or symptoms not associated with current disease or treatments). Importantly, an\nindividual with GAD has worries about a range of other, noncancer topics and areas of his/her life.\nIt is important to determine the associated home, relationship, social, or occupational impairments, if any, and the duration of anxiety-related symptoms.\nAs noted above, problem checklists can be used."}}, "8cd46935-1fbf-4a09-8219-9d502f84401a": {"node_ids": ["aa2e9c8e-b4c9-4460-9aaf-e1bfbdf798a7"], "metadata": {"page_number": 31, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["anxiety", "screening", "assessment", "referral", "psychiatrist", "psychologist", "culturally sensitive", "learning disabilities", "cognitive impairments"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "As noted above, problem checklists can be used.

Caregivers have to cope with the\nphysical aftermath of the survivors\u2019 treatment and manage their\nlong-term and late effects in addition to their own psychosocial\nand physical unmet needs.230 Research has shown that, for 14 to\n24 months after a survivor\u2019s cancer diagnosis, caregivers provide\nconsistent, continuing care involvement231 for patients after breast\ncancer treatment. Successful coordination of care involves not only a\ncomprehensive care team, including primary care clinicians, but also\nthe informal caregivers (usually the spouse/partner/family member)\nwho provide ongoing care to cancer survivors in the home.232\nFurthermore, most caregivers are older adults who are also man-\naging their own health problems. When possible, primary care\nclinicians should include caregivers of breast cancer survivors in all\nfollow-up care appointments to optimize survivor wellness.\nDISCUSSION\nA signi\ufb01cant limitation of this guideline is the limited evidence base\nwith which to provide clear and speci\ufb01c recommendations for the\nprevention and management of long-term and late effects of cancer\nsurvivors. There are few prospective, RCTs testing interventions\namong breast cancer survivors, although studies in breast cancer\nsurvivors dominate the survivorship literature. The majority of the\ncitations characterizing the risk and magnitude of risk of late effects\nand management recommendations relied predominantly on case-\ncontrol studies with fewer than 500 participants and reviews that\ncombined studies with various outcome measures. There were several\ncohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of\nlate effects.\nAnother limitation is the reliance on previous guidelines for\nsurveillance and symptom management. In addition, the literature\nreview was not managed by a clinical epidemiologist because of limited\nresources and, instead, was conducted by project staff and an ACS\nlibrarian. Furthermore, the guidelines did not result directly from the\ndevelopment of speci\ufb01c clinical questions asked before the literature\nreview; and guidelines included in the literature review were not\nevaluated through an instrument such as the Rigor of Development\nsubscale of the Appraisal for Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE II).

Racial and ethnic\ndisparities in health care contribute signi\ufb01cantly to this problem in the\nUnited States. Patients with cancer who are members of racial/ethnic\nminorities suffer disproportionately from comorbidities, experience\nmore substantial obstacles to receiving care, are more likely to be\nuninsured, and are at greater risk of receiving poor-quality care than\nother Americans.233-236 Many other patients lack access to care\nbecause of their geographic location and distance from appropriate\ntreatment facilities. Awareness of these disparities in access to care\nshould be considered in the context of this clinical practice guideline,\nand health care providers should strive to deliver the highest level of\ncancer care to these vulnerable populations.\nThe ACS and ASCO believe that cancer clinical trials are vital\nto inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all\npatients should have the opportunity to participate.\nMULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS\nCreating evidence-based recommendations to inform the\ntreatment of patients with additional chronic conditions, a sit-\nuation in which the patient may have two or more such con-\nditions\u2014referred to as multiple chronic conditions (MCCs)\u2014is\nchallenging.237 Patients with MCCs are a complex and heteroge-\nneous population, making it dif\ufb01cult to account for all of the\npossible permutations to develop speci\ufb01c recommendations for\ncare. In addition, the best available evidence for treating index\nconditions, such as cancer, is often from clinical trials in which\nstudy selection criteria may exclude these patients to avoid\npotential interaction effects or confounding of results associated\nwith MCCs."}}, "62b40f0b-9e8e-4234-9beb-97d9d4fba471": {"node_ids": ["e4b53c87-a60e-4369-a7ab-2d105127118e"], "metadata": {"page_number": 20, "doc_title": "American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline", "keywords": ["ACS", "ASCO", "guidelines", "resources"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "groups to make recommendations for care in this heterogeneous\npatient population.\nBecause many patients for whom guideline recommendations\napply present with MCCs, any treatment plan needs to take into\naccount the complexity and uncertainty created by the presence of\nMCCs and should highlight the importance of shared decision\nmaking regarding guideline use and implementation. Therefore, in\nconsideration of recommended care for the target index condition,\nclinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in the\npatient and take those conditions into account when formulating\nthe treatment and follow-up plan.\nIn light of these considerations, practice guidelines should\nprovide information on how to apply the recommendations for\npatients with MCCs, perhaps as a qualifying statement for rec-\nommended care.

Breast cancer survivors also need to be counseled on health\npromotion strategies to minimize and mitigate long-term and late\neffects, to ameliorate comorbid health conditions, and to potentially\nincrease survival.\nTo clarify the roles of all clinicians working with cancer survivors,\nwe concur with the Institute of Medicine that survivors and primary\ncare clinicians should receive a survivorship care plan that includes a\nconcise summary of treatment as well as a clinical follow-up care plan.\nIdeally, this plan would be constructed in partnership with the sur-\nvivor to identify and prioritize goals for survivorship care and would\nbe communicated to the patient to ensure their understanding of\nindividual risks; recommended tests, procedures, and supportive care\nstrategies; and how to optimize wellness. Survivorship care should be\ncoordinated with treating cancer specialists.\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nIn addition to this guideline, tools and resources are available to assist\nprimary care clinicians in implementing these recommendations. CA\noffers a Patient Page (onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21322/\npdf) to help patients understand how to use this guideline to talk to\ntheir doctor about surveillance and screening, symptom management,\nhealthy behaviors, and care coordination. CA also offers free con-\ntinuing medical education and free continuing nursing education for\nthis article at acsjournals.com/ce as an additional resource for\nphysicians and nurses. The Survivorship Center also offers The GW\nCancer Institute\u2019s Cancer Survivorship E-Learning Series for Primary\nCare Providers (The E-Learning Series), a free, innovative, online,\ncontinuing education program to educate primary care clinicians\nabout how to better understand and care for survivors in the primary\ncare setting. Continuing education credits are available at no cost to\nphysicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and physician assistants for\neach 1-hour module.

Radiation, chemotherapy, and\nhormonal/endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors have been\nassociated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in\npatients with breast cancer.70,71 The risk of heart disease increases\nin postmenopausal women, as endogenous estrogens in younger\nwomen contribute to the low prevalence of cardiovascular disease\nin that population. Therefore, breast cancer patients who experience\ntreatment-related early menopause may be at higher risk for heart\ndisease than age-matched women in the general population. The\nchemotherapeutic agents epirubicin and doxorubicin are associated\nwith a low but real risk of cardiomyopathy72; similarly, trastuzumab\nis associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction, most\nnotably when given concomitantly or after an anthracycline, as has\nbeen detailed by the European Society for Medical Oncology.73\nAromatase inhibitors can raise cholesterol levels74,75 and the risk\nof diabetes. Signi\ufb01cant weight gain may lead to hypertension and\ninsulin resistance, which further elevate the risk of cardiovascular\ndisease.

Caregivers have to cope with the\nphysical aftermath of the survivors\u2019 treatment and manage their\nlong-term and late effects in addition to their own psychosocial\nand physical unmet needs.230 Research has shown that, for 14 to\n24 months after a survivor\u2019s cancer diagnosis, caregivers provide\nconsistent, continuing care involvement231 for patients after breast\ncancer treatment.

There were several\ncohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of\nlate effects.\nAnother limitation is the reliance on previous guidelines for\nsurveillance and symptom management. In addition, the literature\nreview was not managed by a clinical epidemiologist because of limited\nresources and, instead, was conducted by project staff and an ACS\nlibrarian. Furthermore, the guidelines did not result directly from the\ndevelopment of speci\ufb01c clinical questions asked before the literature\nreview; and guidelines included in the literature review were not\nevaluated through an instrument such as the Rigor of Development\nsubscale of the Appraisal for Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE II).

Patients with cancer who are members of racial/ethnic\nminorities suffer disproportionately from comorbidities, experience\nmore substantial obstacles to receiving care, are more likely to be\nuninsured, and are at greater risk of receiving poor-quality care than\nother Americans.233-236 Many other patients lack access to care\nbecause of their geographic location and distance from appropriate\ntreatment facilities. Awareness of these disparities in access to care\nshould be considered in the context of this clinical practice guideline,\nand health care providers should strive to deliver the highest level of\ncancer care to these vulnerable populations.\nThe ACS and ASCO believe that cancer clinical trials are vital\nto inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all\npatients should have the opportunity to participate.\nMULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS\nCreating evidence-based recommendations to inform the\ntreatment of patients with additional chronic conditions, a sit-\nuation in which the patient may have two or more such con-\nditions\u2014referred to as multiple chronic conditions (MCCs)\u2014is\nchallenging.237 Patients with MCCs are a complex and heteroge-\nneous population, making it dif\ufb01cult to account for all of the\npossible permutations to develop speci\ufb01c recommendations for\ncare. In addition, the best available evidence for treating index\nconditions, such as cancer, is often from clinical trials in which\nstudy selection criteria may exclude these patients to avoid\npotential interaction effects or confounding of results associated\nwith MCCs."}}, "cb326e15-c93f-46df-a0a1-97c140288217": {"node_ids": ["23fc71ef-adfb-44d7-b80f-5d6d3d663b31"], "metadata": {"page_number": 20, "doc_title": "American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline", "keywords": ["ACS guidelines", "ASCO guidelines", "CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians", "Journal of Clinical Oncology"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "groups to make recommendations for care in this heterogeneous\npatient population.\nBecause many patients for whom guideline recommendations\napply present with MCCs, any treatment plan needs to take into\naccount the complexity and uncertainty created by the presence of\nMCCs and should highlight the importance of shared decision\nmaking regarding guideline use and implementation. Therefore, in\nconsideration of recommended care for the target index condition,\nclinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in the\npatient and take those conditions into account when formulating\nthe treatment and follow-up plan.\nIn light of these considerations, practice guidelines should\nprovide information on how to apply the recommendations for\npatients with MCCs, perhaps as a qualifying statement for rec-\nommended care. This may mean that some or all of the recom-\nmended care options are modi\ufb01ed or not applied, as determined by\nbest practice in consideration of any MCCs.\nEXTERNAL REVIEW\nAfter \ufb01nalization by the workgroup, the guideline was sent to addi-\ntional internal experts (ACS and ASCO) and external experts for review\nand comment before submission for publication. Review comments\nwere reviewed by the expert panel and integrated into the \ufb01nal article\nbefore approval by the Clinical Practice Guideline Committee.\nGUIDELINE IMPLEMENTATION\nACS/ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across health\nsettings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase\nawareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line\npractitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to\nprovide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The\nguideline Bottom Line Box (Table 1) was designed to facilitate the\nimplementation of recommendations. This guideline will be dis-\ntributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementa-\ntion Network. ACS/ASCO guidelines are posted on the ACS and\nASCO websites. This joint ACS-ASCO guideline is published in both\nCA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and in Journal of Clinical Oncology.\nSUMMARY\nBreast cancer survivors face potentially signi\ufb01cant impacts of cancer\nand its treatment and deserve high-quality, comprehensive, coor-\ndinated clinical follow-up care.

Breast cancer survivors also need to be counseled on health\npromotion strategies to minimize and mitigate long-term and late\neffects, to ameliorate comorbid health conditions, and to potentially\nincrease survival.\nTo clarify the roles of all clinicians working with cancer survivors,\nwe concur with the Institute of Medicine that survivors and primary\ncare clinicians should receive a survivorship care plan that includes a\nconcise summary of treatment as well as a clinical follow-up care plan.\nIdeally, this plan would be constructed in partnership with the sur-\nvivor to identify and prioritize goals for survivorship care and would\nbe communicated to the patient to ensure their understanding of\nindividual risks; recommended tests, procedures, and supportive care\nstrategies; and how to optimize wellness. Survivorship care should be\ncoordinated with treating cancer specialists.\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nIn addition to this guideline, tools and resources are available to assist\nprimary care clinicians in implementing these recommendations. CA\noffers a Patient Page (onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21322/\npdf) to help patients understand how to use this guideline to talk to\ntheir doctor about surveillance and screening, symptom management,\nhealthy behaviors, and care coordination. CA also offers free con-\ntinuing medical education and free continuing nursing education for\nthis article at acsjournals.com/ce as an additional resource for\nphysicians and nurses. The Survivorship Center also offers The GW\nCancer Institute\u2019s Cancer Survivorship E-Learning Series for Primary\nCare Providers (The E-Learning Series), a free, innovative, online,\ncontinuing education program to educate primary care clinicians\nabout how to better understand and care for survivors in the primary\ncare setting.

It is important for oncologists and advanced care\npractitioners to initiate the discussion regarding the potential for\ncardiac dysfunction in individuals in whom the risk is suf\ufb01ciently\nhigh before starting therapy. Hearing about potential complications\nfrom therapy early in the cancer journey can be dif\ufb01cult for patients\nwith cancer to process, because their primary focus is surviving their\nmalignancy. However, clear provider-patient communication may\nlead to appropriate monitoring and implementation of potential\npreventive strategies. A baseline cardiac dysfunction risk assessment\nby the oncology care provider(s) is important before therapy. For\nhigh-risk patients, a tailored and detailed plan for cardiac moni-\ntoring throughout treatment and beyond should also be established.\nPatients also need to be advised that cardiac dysfunction can be\na progressive disorder and may initially be asymptomatic; therefore,\nearly and late warning signs and symptoms should be discussed and\nreported to the primary oncology team or to a cardiologist. A heart-\nhealthy lifestyle, including the role of diet and exercise, should be\ndiscussed with all patients with cancer before and after completion\nof their cancer therapy.\nHEALTH DISPARITIES\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert rec-\nommendations on the best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to medical care. Racial and\nethnic disparities in health care contribute signi\ufb01cantly to this\nproblem in the United States."}}, "c113bbef-bd75-43ce-92a4-c1f05a83c8d5": {"node_ids": ["562e3207-b2df-405e-8b2e-474cec985c83"], "metadata": {"page_number": 15, "doc_title": "Prevention and Monitoring of Cardiac Dysfunction in Survivors of Adult Cancers: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline", "keywords": ["cardiovascular complications", "cancer treatment", "racial disparities", "ethnic disparities"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "Racial and\nethnic disparities in health care contribute signi\ufb01cantly to this\nproblem in the United States. Patients with cancer who are\nmembers of racial or ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately\nfrom comorbidities, experience more substantial obstacles to re-\nceiving care, are more likely to be uninsured, and are at greater risk\nof receiving care of poor quality than other Americans.158 Racial\nand ethnic minorities with existing disparities in cardiovascular\noutcomes may have a substantially higher burden of cardiovascular\ncomplications during and after cancer treatment, in part because\nof inequities in the management of cardiovascular risk factors.\nAfrican Americans, for example, have signi\ufb01cantly higher rates of\nhypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease\u2013related com-\nplications when compared with nonminority groups.159 At the\nsame time, African American women with breast cancer have the\npoorest cancer-speci\ufb01c and overall survival, and a signi\ufb01cant\ncomponent of the disparity in mortality has been attributed to\ndisparity in cardiovascular comorbidities.159,160 Many other pa-\ntients lack access to care because of their geographic location and\ndistance from appropriate treatment facilities.

It\nis a persistent, often overwhelming feeling of physical,\nmental, and/or emotional exhaustion and differs from\nfatigue caused by exertion as it is not necessarily relieved by\nrest or sleep. CRF can affect people with cancer at any stage of\nthe disease and at any time in the cancer trajectory, from\ndiagnosis through long-term survivorship. Prevalence es-\ntimates indicate that 30%-60% of patients experience\nmoderate to severe fatigue during treatment and 20%-30%\ncontinue to experience fatigue for months or years after\ntreatment completion.1-3 CRF has debilitating effects on all\naspects of quality of life, including physical, emotional,\nsocial, and occupational functioning.4 The etiology of CRF is\ncomplex and multifaceted, and it can be challenging to\nidentify contributing factors since multiple causes fre-\nquently exist simultaneously, often with additive effects.5 As\nanother layer of complexity, the factors that precipitate\nfatigue\nmay\nnot\nbe\nthe\nsame\nones\nthat\nlead\nto\nits\npersistence.2,6 Multiple factors contribute to CRF, including\nthe cancer itself, effects of cancer treatments, physical and\npsychological comorbidities (eg, depression), other physical\nsymptoms (eg, pain, sleep disturbance), physical inactivity\nand deconditioning, and cognitive, emotional, and behav-\nioral responses to diagnosis and treatment. Despite the high\nprevalence of CRF, patient management is often complicated\nby the misconception held by patients, their caregivers, and\neven clinical staff that fatigue is an inevitable and un-\navoidable consequence of cancer and its treatment.5\nThe purpose of this guideline update is to gather and ex-\namine the evidence published since the 2014 guideline by\nBower et al7 and offer a series of updated recommendations\nfor management of CRF. Although the original guideline\nconsidered fatigue in patients with cancer after completion\nof primary treatment, the Expert Panel recognizes that the\ntreatment landscape has changed and an increasing number\nof patients are on extended treatments, with the advent of\ntargeted therapy and immunotherapy."}}, "c8a3ed7b-72e6-40cf-bad2-05e9b1327831": {"node_ids": ["32c8bfff-4caa-4e3f-a9d1-16c58c884401"], "metadata": {"page_number": 2, "doc_title": "Management of Fatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO\u2013Society for Integrative Oncology Guideline Update", "keywords": ["cancer-related fatigue", "CRF", "management", "treatment", "screening", "assessment"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "As such, this update\nwill encompass all adult cancer survivors, de\ufb01ned as be-\nginning from the time of diagnosis onward.

PubMed was searched from January 2013 through\nto October 2023 for phase II and phase III randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs). The reference lists of all identi\ufb01ed\narticles were also hand searched for additional studies.\nAs the guideline was being developed, concerns were raised\nthat the updated body of evidence alone was inadequate to\ninform some recommendations. While the focus of the\nsystematic review was deliberately placed on identifying and\nincorporating new evidence from the updated literature\nsearch, older trials that met search criteria were identi\ufb01ed\nthrough existing systematic reviews or meta-analyses and\nconsidered when necessary to provide a more comprehen-\nsive evidentiary base from which to develop recommenda-\ntions. When older studies aligned and supported the updated\nrecommendations, they were not discussed further in this\nupdate. An aim of the update is to emphasize the contem-\nporaneity of the research landscape and not provide an\nexhaustive discussion of older studies.\nArticles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review\non the basis of the following criteria."}}, "6e0463b1-b3fc-4b1d-83b3-201b8b1f9668": {"node_ids": ["4409aa29-44e2-4b82-85ec-c96967c9dbb5"], "metadata": {"page_number": 2, "doc_title": "Management of Fatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO\u2013Society for Integrative Oncology Guideline Update", "keywords": ["Journal of Clinical Oncology", "resources", "cancer survivors"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "Articles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review\non the basis of the following criteria.\n\u2022 Population: adult patients with CRF under active cancer\ntreatment and survivors after completion of treatment\nTARGET POPULATION AND AUDIENCE\nTarget Population\nSurvivors of adult cancer, de\ufb01ned as starting from the\ntime of diagnosis to any time thereafter, with cancer-\nrelated fatigue.\nTarget Audience\nHealth care providers including oncologists, primary\ncare providers, psychologists, psychiatrists, psychoso-\ncial professionals, exercise oncology professionals, re-\nhabilitation\nprofessionals,\nintegrative\nmedicine\npractitioners, nurses, and others involved in the delivery\nof care for survivors as well as patients, family members,\nand caregivers of patients and survivors of cancer.\nJournal of Clinical Oncology\nascopubs.org/journal/jco | Volume 42, Issue 20 | 2457\nFatigue in Adult Cancer Survivors\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 68.180.32.21 on October 2, 2024 from 068.180.032.021\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Patients\nrandomly assigned to CBT plus hypnosis had signi\ufb01cantly\nlower levels of fatigue at the end of radiotherapy and at 4-\nweek and 6-month follow-up compared to the control group\n(all P < .001).52 The trial was assessed to be at a low risk of\nbias.

Finally, a trial in 220 patients with various\nmalignancies found that CBT given during curative cancer\ntreatment led to signi\ufb01cantly lower fatigue 2 months after\ncancer treatment compared to usual care.121 This trial was at a\nlow risk of bias."}}, "cb5af47a-b2c6-463f-a2e5-4e303168cd1a": {"node_ids": ["1856fcbc-7a3b-44ef-8955-056bc160bf0a"], "metadata": {"page_number": 11, "doc_title": "Management of Fatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO\u2013Society for Integrative Oncology Guideline Update", "keywords": ["CBT", "fatigue", "psychological factors", "cognitive issues", "concentration", "memory problems"], "information_category": "Possible other issues that cancer survivors may experience", "source": "Of note, a follow-up study found that the\nbene\ufb01cial effects of CBT were most pronounced among pa-\ntients with concentration and memory problems.134\nGiven the positive results of the three trials included in this\nreview, the panel concluded that CBT is ef\ufb01cacious in re-\nducing fatigue in patients undergoing cancer treatment.\nFindings from these trials are consistent with a broader lit-\nerature on the ef\ufb01cacy of CBT for reducing fatigue in patients\nwith other illnesses.135-137 CBT-based interventions recognize\nthe intricate interplay between psychological and physical\nfactors and address the maladaptive cognitions and behaviors\nthat are known to in\ufb02uence fatigue (eg, catastrophizing).138\nThe assumption of CBT-based interventions is not that fatigue\nand other symptoms are \u201call in a patient\u2019s head\u201d.

One plausible approach within the US health care\nsystem involves integrating costs into insurance coverage,\nensuring continual support for system maintenance and user\nassistance,194 and thereby optimizing the impact of digital\ninterventions in care for cancer survivors.\nOlder Adults With Cancer\nOlder adults with cancer often have unique needs and\nconsiderations when it comes to management of their CRF.\nOlder patients with cancer might have multiple chronic\nconditions, increased medication burden, and decreased\nphysical and cognitive function, which can exacerbate their\nexperience of fatigue. In addition, they might have limited\nsupport systems and social isolation, intensifying their\nsymptoms. As such, the treatment of CRF in older adults\nrequires a comprehensive and individualized approach that\naccounts for such concerns. This may include the imple-\nmentation of interventions that target modi\ufb01able risk fac-\ntors, such as physical activity programs, as well as the\nprovision of supportive care services, such as counseling and\nsocial support groups, to address the physical, emotional,\nand psychological impact of cancer and its treatment.\nLIMITATION OF THE RESEARCH AND FUTURE RESEARCH\nStudies investigating the management of fatigue in patients\nwith cancer pose numerous challenges. Notably, the literature\nincludes many studies on interventions for patients experi-\nencing subthreshold levels of fatigue, making it challenging to\nobserve treatment effects because of \ufb02oor effects. Under-\npowered trials, unable to detect differences between treatment\nand control groups, are also a signi\ufb01cant concern. Moreover,\nplacebo effects cannot be discounted.

Furthermore, the comprehensive care of these individuals\nshould address both cancer-related and general care needs. These needs include not only\nongoing surveillance for disease recurrence or progression, but also monitoring and man-\nagement of psychosocial issues and chronic medical conditions, general health promotion,\nand disease prevention [14]. Community primary care teams should provide counselling\non the importance of smoking cessation and vaccinations for in\ufb02uenza, Streptococcus\npneumoniae, and COVID-19, among others. The implications of common comorbidities,\nsuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, should also be discussed.\nThroughout the course of treatment and follow-up of patients with stage III unre-\nsectable NSCLC, the family physician/community primary care team should be kept in-\nformed of the results of all clinical assessments and continue to provide care for non-cancer\nhealth, family, and psychosocial concerns. All patients should receive a summary of key\nhealth-related items for consideration and follow-up over the course of their disease. This\nsummary should include information regarding the potential impact of cancer therapy on\ntheir health, including current comorbidities and the risk of new long-term complications.\n4. Conclusions\nThe favorable \ufb01ve-year survival results of the PACIFIC trial of durvalumab have\nprompted reconsideration of best follow-up imaging practices for patients with stage III\nunresectable NSCLC.
