These Multinational Association\nfor Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC)-ASCO standards and practice recom-\nmendations seek to establish consistent provision of quality survivorship care\nfor people affected by advanced or metastatic cancer.\nMETHODS\nA MASCC-ASCO expert panel was formed. Standards and recommendations\nrelevant to the provision of quality survivorship care for people affected by\nadvanced or metastatic cancer were developed through conducting (1) a sys-\ntematic review of unmet supportive care needs; (2) a scoping review of cancer\nsurvivorship, supportive care, and palliative care frameworks and guidelines;\nand (3) an international modi\ufb01ed Delphi consensus process.\nRESULTS\nA systematic review involving 81 studies and a scoping review of 17 guidelines\nand frameworks informed the initial standards and recommendations."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["page_number", "information_category", "source"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "052945f6-199d-4122-a5f8-09c8c3968b18", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_number": 1, "doc_title": "Survivorship Care for People Affected by Advanced or Metastatic Cancer: MASCC-ASCO Standards and Practice Recommendations", "keywords": ["supportive care needs", "survivorship care", "palliative care", "frameworks", "guidelines"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "Special Articles\nSurvivorship Care for People Affected by Advanced or\nMetastatic Cancer: MASCC-ASCO Standards and\nPractice Recommendations\nNicolas H.

These Multinational Association\nfor Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC)-ASCO standards and practice recom-\nmendations seek to establish consistent provision of quality survivorship care\nfor people affected by advanced or metastatic cancer.\nMETHODS\nA MASCC-ASCO expert panel was formed. Standards and recommendations\nrelevant to the provision of quality survivorship care for people affected by\nadvanced or metastatic cancer were developed through conducting (1) a sys-\ntematic review of unmet supportive care needs; (2) a scoping review of cancer\nsurvivorship, supportive care, and palliative care frameworks and guidelines;\nand (3) an international modi\ufb01ed Delphi consensus process.\nRESULTS\nA systematic review involving 81 studies and a scoping review of 17 guidelines\nand frameworks informed the initial standards and recommendations."}, "hash": "7f7d1264af17464adb661525dfb340d223bddf8eba8d6c2cc05c45541f1649f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The MASCC-ASCO expert panel conducted a systematic review of unmet supportive care needs and a scoping review of cancer survivorship, supportive care, and palliative care frameworks and guidelines to develop the standards and recommendations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 242, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3ff5a52-03cb-483c-83e0-bd9e8e7c1dd9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3ff5a52-03cb-483c-83e0-bd9e8e7c1dd9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_number": 1, "doc_title": "Survivorship Care for People Affected by Advanced or Metastatic Cancer: MASCC-ASCO Standards and Practice Recommendations", "keywords": ["survivorship care", "standards", "MASCC-ASCO", "health outcomes"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "RESULTS\nA systematic review involving 81 studies and a scoping review of 17 guidelines\nand frameworks informed the initial standards and recommendations.

A\ntotal of 3 systematic reviews, 2 with meta-analyses, and 28 primary trials for prevention of CIPN in addition to 14\nprimary trials related to treatment of established CIPN, are included in this update.\nRECOMMENDATIONS The identi\ufb01ed data recon\ufb01rmed that no agents are recommended for the prevention of\nCIPN. The use of acetyl-L-carnitine for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer should be discouraged.\nFurthermore, clinicians should assess the appropriateness of dose delaying, dose reduction, substitutions, or\nstopping chemotherapy in patients who develop intolerable neuropathy and/or functional impairment.\nDuloxetine is the only agent that has appropriate evidence to support its use for patients with established painful\nCIPN. Nonetheless, the amount of bene\ufb01t from duloxetine is limited.\nAdditional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines.\nJ Clin Oncol 38:3325-3348."}}, "254fb62d-d0db-431c-8f34-534864ca307e": {"node_ids": ["06111391-33a4-4e23-8626-a4025c570a8c"], "metadata": {"page_number": 4, "doc_title": "Prevention and Management of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Survivors of Adult Cancers: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["guideline update", "prevention", "treatment", "CIPN"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "oxaliplatin-induced symptoms experienced during treat-\nment are more severe in the upper extremities than in the\nlower extremities.\nAfter completion of chemotherapy treatments, paclitaxel\nneuropathy, on average, improves over the ensuing several\nmonths. In contrast, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, on\naverage, worsens for 2-3 months after cessation of therapy\n(labeled as coasting phenomenon); after approximately 3\nmonths, neuropathy tends to improve.3 Neuropathy in the\nhands improves faster than in the feet, so that, months after\ncompletion of oxaliplatin, neuropathy is worse in the feet\nthan in the hands. Although neuropathy caused by both\ndrugs tends to improve over time, neuropathy can remain\nas a substantial debilitating problem in a subset of patients\nfor years.6,7\nThe diagnosis of the more chronic chemotherapy-induced\nperipheral neuropathy can generally be made by clinical\nhistory. If a patient receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy\ndevelops new or worsening numbness, tingling, and/or pain\nin their hands and/or feet, and there is no other good reason\nfor them to have developed these symptoms, then the\ndiagnosis is made. Neurologic physical examination can be\nabnormal in a patient with chemotherapy-induced pe-\nripheral neuropathy. Neurologic tests, such as electromy-\nography (EMG), can be used but are not usually necessary.\nThere are data supporting that nerve conduction studies in\nasymptomatic patients who are receiving neurotoxic che-\nmotherapy can predict the development or worsening of\nchemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).8-10\nThese tests, however, are not routinely used.\nChemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can mark-\nedly affect the quality of life (QOL) of patients.

All ASCO guidelines are\nultimately reviewed and approved by the Expert Panel and\nthe ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee before\npublication. All funding for the administration of the project\nwas provided by ASCO.\nThe recommendations were developed using a systematic\nreview and informed by expert clinical experience.

Of course, this is good news,\nbut it sometimes comes at a cost. Put simply, chronic pain from\ntreatment-related adverse effects can signi\ufb01cantly affect the quality\nof life of many cancer survivors for years after initial treatment\nstops. Chronic pain can develop from a variety of sources: pe-\nripheral neuropathy, muscle or bone pain, surgery, radiation, and\nother conditions. Comorbidity with other conditions or syn-\ndromes can make assessing chronic pain more dif\ufb01cult. Because\npost-treatment pain is so complicated, good communication be-\ntween patients and their medical providers is essential. Cancer\nsurvivors are more than their cancer history or their pain; they are\nindividuals with unique needs. They may have varying capacities to\ndeal with a great deal of information that can sometimes be\noverwhelming. Just as no two cancers are alike, patients experience\npain differently. Some patients may even be reluctant to discuss\ntheir pain, seeing it as a sign of weakness or fearing a recurrence;\nsome may see it an expected and untreatable complication of their\ncancer treatment. That is why a pain assessment is recommended at\nevery visit. In teasing out how they are coping, clinicians need to\nask patients how chronic pain is affecting them and suggest how\nthey can work together to better manage their symptoms and\nimprove their quality of life. Survivors who understand all aspects\nof their pain treatment plan (and their role in it) may have a better\noverall outcome.\nHealth Disparities\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert\nrecommendations on best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to health care.

One way\nexclusiveness or lack of accessibility may be communi-\ncated is through gendered language that makes pre-\nsumptive links between gender and anatomy.172-175 With\nthe acknowledgment that ASCO guidelines may impact the\nlanguage used in clinical and research settings, ASCO is\ncommitted to creating gender-inclusive guidelines. For this\nreason, guideline authors use gender-inclusive language\nwhenever possible throughout the guidelines. In instances\nin which the guideline draws upon data based on gendered\nresearch (eg, studies regarding women with ovarian can-\ncer), the guideline authors describe the characteristics and\nresults of the research as reported.\nRELATED ASCO GUIDELINES\n\u2022 Screening, Assessment, and Care of Anxiety and\nDepressive Symptoms in Adults with Cancer7\n(https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/jco.2013."}}, "8beb3290-aed4-4c76-bac5-073f92e1ce8a": {"node_ids": ["5e395cd7-2e9a-4e01-8329-f21f084ad8a1"], "metadata": {"page_number": 30, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["PHQ-9", "screening", "depressive symptoms", "assessment", "cutoff score"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "APPENDIX\nTABLE A1. Recommendations on Screening and Assessment of Depression and Anxiety\nRecommendation\nScreening for depressive symptoms\nAll patients should be screened for depressive symptoms at their initial visit, at appropriate intervals, and as clinically indicated, especially with changes\nin disease or treatment status (ie, post-treatment, recurrence, progression) and transition to palliative and end-of-life care.\nThe CAPO and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (the Partnership) guideline Assessment of Psychosocial Health Care Needs of the Adult\nCancer Patient suggests screening at initial diagnosis, start of treatment, regular intervals during treatment, end of treatment, post-treatment or at\ntransition to survivorship, at recurrence or progression, advanced disease, when dying, and during times of personal transition or reappraisal such\nas family crisis, during post-treatment survivorship, and when approaching death.a\nScreening should be done using a valid and reliable measure that features reportable scores (dimensions) that are clinically meaningful (established\ncutoffs).a\nWhen assessing a person who may have depressive symptoms, a phased screening and assessment is recommended that does not rely simply on a\nsymptom count.\nAs a \ufb01rst step for all patients, identi\ufb01cation of the presence or absence of pertinent history or risk factors (see Depression Algorithm, Fig 1) is important\nfor subsequent assessment and treatment decision making.\nAs a second step, two items from the PHQ-9 can be used to assess for the classic depressive symptoms of low mood and anhedonia. For individuals\nendorsing either item (or both) as occurring for more than half of the time or nearly every day within the last two weeks (ie, a score of . 2), a third\nstep is suggested in which the patient completes the remaining items of the PHQ-9. It is estimated that 25%-30% of patients would need to\ncomplete the remaining items.\nThe traditional cutoff for the PHQ-9 is . 10. The Panel\u2019s recommended cutoff score of . 8 is based on a study of the diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ-\n9 with cancer outpatients. A meta-analysis by Manea et al also supports the . 8 cutoff score.\nFor patients completing the latter step, it is important to determine the associated sociodemographic, psychiatric or health comorbidities, or social\nimpairments, if any, and the duration that depressive symptoms have been present."}}, "6a269a89-aef6-44bf-8fd2-24c3205c5c4f": {"node_ids": ["de76774c-96d3-4872-8fef-1e160d5e3df0"], "metadata": {"page_number": 32, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["recommendation ratings", "quality of evidence", "cancer survivorship care"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "TABLE A2.

Caregivers have to cope with the\nphysical aftermath of the survivors\u2019 treatment and manage their\nlong-term and late effects in addition to their own psychosocial\nand physical unmet needs.230 Research has shown that, for 14 to\n24 months after a survivor\u2019s cancer diagnosis, caregivers provide\nconsistent, continuing care involvement231 for patients after breast\ncancer treatment. Successful coordination of care involves not only a\ncomprehensive care team, including primary care clinicians, but also\nthe informal caregivers (usually the spouse/partner/family member)\nwho provide ongoing care to cancer survivors in the home.232\nFurthermore, most caregivers are older adults who are also man-\naging their own health problems. When possible, primary care\nclinicians should include caregivers of breast cancer survivors in all\nfollow-up care appointments to optimize survivor wellness.\nDISCUSSION\nA signi\ufb01cant limitation of this guideline is the limited evidence base\nwith which to provide clear and speci\ufb01c recommendations for the\nprevention and management of long-term and late effects of cancer\nsurvivors. There are few prospective, RCTs testing interventions\namong breast cancer survivors, although studies in breast cancer\nsurvivors dominate the survivorship literature. The majority of the\ncitations characterizing the risk and magnitude of risk of late effects\nand management recommendations relied predominantly on case-\ncontrol studies with fewer than 500 participants and reviews that\ncombined studies with various outcome measures. There were several\ncohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of\nlate effects.\nAnother limitation is the reliance on previous guidelines for\nsurveillance and symptom management. In addition, the literature\nreview was not managed by a clinical epidemiologist because of limited\nresources and, instead, was conducted by project staff and an ACS\nlibrarian.

Racial and ethnic\ndisparities in health care contribute signi\ufb01cantly to this problem in the\nUnited States. Patients with cancer who are members of racial/ethnic\nminorities suffer disproportionately from comorbidities, experience\nmore substantial obstacles to receiving care, are more likely to be\nuninsured, and are at greater risk of receiving poor-quality care than\nother Americans.233-236 Many other patients lack access to care\nbecause of their geographic location and distance from appropriate\ntreatment facilities. Awareness of these disparities in access to care\nshould be considered in the context of this clinical practice guideline,\nand health care providers should strive to deliver the highest level of\ncancer care to these vulnerable populations.\nThe ACS and ASCO believe that cancer clinical trials are vital\nto inform medical decisions and improve cancer care and that all\npatients should have the opportunity to participate.\nMULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS\nCreating evidence-based recommendations to inform the\ntreatment of patients with additional chronic conditions, a sit-\nuation in which the patient may have two or more such con-\nditions\u2014referred to as multiple chronic conditions (MCCs)\u2014is\nchallenging.237 Patients with MCCs are a complex and heteroge-\nneous population, making it dif\ufb01cult to account for all of the\npossible permutations to develop speci\ufb01c recommendations for\ncare.

In children (# 21 years old at\ndiagnosis) with cancer, the short- and long-term risk of cardiac\ndysfunction associated with therapeutic exposures, such as\nanthracycline chemotherapy (eg, doxorubicin, epirubicin, dau-\nnorubicin) or use of chest-directed RT. is well described.3 This led\nto the development of evidence-based guidelines to direct sur-\nveillance and prevention of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of\nchildhood cancer.4 The need for comparable screening guidelines\nin survivors of adult-onset cancers is paramount, so that proper\ninterventions can be implemented to avert the risk of cardiac\ndysfunction during and after completion of therapy.\nIn recognition of the increasing need for guidance, the ASCO\nSurvivorship Guidelines Advisory Group recommended this\nguideline topic as a high priority for development, requesting that\nthe emphasis be on cardiac dysfunction (asymptomatic or\nsymptomatic) and that the full scope of therapeutic exposures and\nhealth conditions impacting risk be considered. Although it is well\nestablished that cardiac dysfunction can present as systolic and/or\ndiastolic impairment, there is a paucity of information on the\nincidence and risk factors for diastolic dysfunction in survivors of\nadult-onset cancers. Therefore, the focus of this document is on\nprevention and monitoring of systolic cardiac dysfunction, typi-\ncally detected as low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).\nMoreover, although assessment of coronary artery disease and/or\nother cardiac abnormalities (valvular or pericardial disease) may be\nan important aspect of the comprehensive evaluation of cardiac\nfunction, recommendations for prevention and monitoring of\nthese complications fall outside the scope of this guideline. With\nregard to the medical management of cardiac dysfunction, ref-\nerence will be made to existing treatment guidelines2 as well as\nrelevant studies that address this topic.\nGUIDELINE QUESTIONS\nThis clinical practice guideline addresses the following \ufb01ve over-\narching clinical questions (Fig 1): (1) Which patients with cancer\nare at increased risk for developing cardiac dysfunction? (2) Which\npreventative strategies minimize risk before initiation of therapy?\n(3) Which preventive strategies are effective in minimizing risk\nduring the administration of potentially cardiotoxic cancer ther-\napy?"}}, "00de6706-d69b-4749-9b6b-c2e191b7a9ef": {"node_ids": ["d627f7e6-032f-4d53-8a15-9892e39583ff"], "metadata": {"page_number": 5, "doc_title": "Prevention and Monitoring of Cardiac Dysfunction in Survivors of Adult Cancers: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline", "keywords": ["guideline development", "multidisciplinary", "Expert Panel", "survivorship"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "(3) Which preventive strategies are effective in minimizing risk\nduring the administration of potentially cardiotoxic cancer ther-\napy?

Expert Panel members had\nexpertise in medical oncology, cardiology, RT oncology, imaging, exercise\nphysiology, cancer prevention, and survivorship (Data Supplement). The\nExpert Panel included representatives from the ACC and AHA. In addition,\na survivor of cancer was included to provide a patient perspective. The\nExpert Panel met in person and via teleconference and corresponded\nthrough e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the\nauthors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline,\nprovide critical review, and \ufb01nalize the guideline recommendations. The\nrecommendations were informed by a systematic review (1996 to 2016) of\nrandomized clinical trials (RCTs), observational studies, and clinical\nexperience. Where evidence was lacking but there was a high level of\nagreement among the panel members (. 80% of panelists), informal\nconsensus was used, as noted with the recommendations. Members of the\nExpert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penulti-\nmate version of the guideline. All ASCO guidelines are ultimately reviewed\nand approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee before\npublication. The guideline also underwent formal review by the ACC and\nAHA and was approved for endorsement by both organizations.\nSystematic Literature Review and Strategy\nASCO guidelines are based on systematic reviews. A protocol for each\nguideline de\ufb01nes the parameters for a targeted literature search including\nrelevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and prespeci\ufb01ed\nstudy selection criteria for identi\ufb01ed literature.

There is currently a paucity of information\nregarding the true incidence and natural history of cardiac dys-\nfunction after completion of cancer-directed therapy.

It is important for oncologists and advanced care\npractitioners to initiate the discussion regarding the potential for\ncardiac dysfunction in individuals in whom the risk is suf\ufb01ciently\nhigh before starting therapy. Hearing about potential complications\nfrom therapy early in the cancer journey can be dif\ufb01cult for patients\nwith cancer to process, because their primary focus is surviving their\nmalignancy. However, clear provider-patient communication may\nlead to appropriate monitoring and implementation of potential\npreventive strategies. A baseline cardiac dysfunction risk assessment\nby the oncology care provider(s) is important before therapy. For\nhigh-risk patients, a tailored and detailed plan for cardiac moni-\ntoring throughout treatment and beyond should also be established.\nPatients also need to be advised that cardiac dysfunction can be\na progressive disorder and may initially be asymptomatic; therefore,\nearly and late warning signs and symptoms should be discussed and\nreported to the primary oncology team or to a cardiologist. A heart-\nhealthy lifestyle, including the role of diet and exercise, should be\ndiscussed with all patients with cancer before and after completion\nof their cancer therapy.\nHEALTH DISPARITIES\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert rec-\nommendations on the best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to medical care.

It addresses\nfatigue symptoms occurring at any stage, spanning from\ndiagnosis through to end of life, and applies to individuals\nundergoing active cancer treatment and those who have\ncompleted their treatment. As screening and assessment for\nfatigue is improving, the research question was revised by\nthe reconvened panel to focus on management and treat-\nment of CRF only. Readers are encouraged to review the\noriginal guideline recommendations on screening and as-\nsessment, which the panel deemed as still relevant.7\nGUIDELINE QUESTIONS\nThis clinical practice guideline addresses one overarching\nclinical question: What are the recommended treatment\napproaches in the management of adult cancer survivors\nwith symptoms of CRF?\nMETHODS\nGuideline Development Process\nThis systematic review-based guideline product was developed\nby a multidisciplinary Expert Panel, which included a patient\nrepresentative and an ASCO guidelines staff member with\nhealth research methodology expertise (Appendix Table A1).\nThe recommendations were developed by using an updated\nsystematic review for evidence published after the previous\nguideline. PubMed was searched from January 2013 through\nto October 2023 for phase II and phase III randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs). The reference lists of all identi\ufb01ed\narticles were also hand searched for additional studies.\nAs the guideline was being developed, concerns were raised\nthat the updated body of evidence alone was inadequate to\ninform some recommendations. While the focus of the\nsystematic review was deliberately placed on identifying and\nincorporating new evidence from the updated literature\nsearch, older trials that met search criteria were identi\ufb01ed\nthrough existing systematic reviews or meta-analyses and\nconsidered when necessary to provide a more comprehen-\nsive evidentiary base from which to develop recommenda-\ntions. When older studies aligned and supported the updated\nrecommendations, they were not discussed further in this\nupdate. An aim of the update is to emphasize the contem-\nporaneity of the research landscape and not provide an\nexhaustive discussion of older studies.\nArticles were selected for inclusion in the systematic review\non the basis of the following criteria."}}, "b95ca48b-7143-48dc-a347-628676a71f46": {"node_ids": ["3e427dbd-5756-4c7a-b651-a793be72fdbe"], "metadata": {"page_number": 3, "doc_title": "Management of Fatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO\u2013Society for Integrative Oncology Guideline Update", "keywords": ["intervention effectiveness", "RCT", "cancer survivorship care"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "Ratings for type and strength of\nthe recommendation and evidence quality are provided with\neach recommendation, de\ufb01ned in Appendix Table A2.

However, addressing symptoms that\nmay precipitate, co-occur with, and help sustain fatigue is\ncritical for effective patient care. Indeed, as discussed in the\noriginal 2014 guideline,7 patients experiencing fatigue should\nalso be evaluated and treated for contributing comorbid\nconditions that commonly cluster with fatigue, including pain,\ndepression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance, as well as nutri-\ntional de\ufb01cit, activity level, anemia, medication adverse\neffects.\nA growing number of integrative therapies have been\nevaluated as treatments for CRF.

This knowledge can pave the way for developing focused\ninterventions tailored to those most susceptible. In addition,\nunderstanding host factors that in\ufb02uence treatment response\nwill facilitate decisions about which interventions will be most\nef\ufb01cacious for which patients.\nNew Cancer Therapies\nSince the publication of the original guideline, the on-\ncology treatment landscape has changed and newer drugs\nsuch as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chimeric\nantigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are more common."}}, "da8b42f7-44e3-4846-bde7-8efdfe3f147f": {"node_ids": ["625ad1f9-7327-477b-a241-9f98e729c51e"], "metadata": {"page_number": 25, "doc_title": "Management of Fatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO\u2013Society for Integrative Oncology Guideline Update", "keywords": ["digital interventions", "cancer-related fatigue", "accessibility", "funding challenges"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "In patients treated with ICIs, fatigue occurs in 21%, 25%, and\n36% of patients treated with anti\u2013PD-[L]1, anti\u2013cytotoxic\nT-lymphocyte\u2013associated protein 4, and combination of ICIs,\nrespectively.190 Fatigue is most likely to occur after the \ufb01rst\nmonth after initiation of ICI therapy;191 however, many pa-\ntients report long-term fatigue.192 Similarly, the most com-\nmon symptom identi\ufb01ed by patients related to treatment with\nCAR T-cell therapy was fatigue in 62% of patients.193 Fatigue\ncan also be a symptom of other forms of immunotherapy\ntoxicity, including adrenal insuf\ufb01ciency, hypothyroidism,\nhypophysitis, hepatitis, renal insuf\ufb01ciency, pneumonitis,\nneurologic toxicities, and anemia.190 The Society for Immu-\nnotherapy of Cancer recommends that an evaluation for\npatients with new or worsening ICI-related fatigue should\ninclude CBC count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-\nstimulating hormone, free thyroxine, morning cortisol, and\nadrenocorticotropic\nhormone.190\nIf\nother\norgan-speci\ufb01c\ntoxicities are ruled out, ICI-related fatigue should be man-\naged similar to CRF.

This\nrestricts access and limits the reach of many interventions.\nHowever, the emergence of digital interventions presents a\npromising solution to this accessibility issue. By leveraging\ninternet or mobile platforms, digital interventions can vastly\nincrease accessibility to fatigue management programs.\nNevertheless,\nthe\nwidespread\nimplementation\nof\nthese\ndigital tools faces hurdles, particularly regarding funding.194\nThe development of guided or fully automated digital in-\nterventions\nnecessitates\nsigni\ufb01cant\nupfront\ninvestment\ncosts, raising questions about sustainable funding models."}}, "70f081be-64ae-4bee-95a8-e2a9044393c6": {"node_ids": ["0816a004-ce02-43ee-8d53-f0b4a38ae1c0"], "metadata": {"page_number": 26, "doc_title": "Management of Fatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO\u2013Society for Integrative Oncology Guideline Update", "keywords": ["Diversity in research", "inclusive research", "demographic diversity"], "information_category": "Additional Information", "source": "with open-label placebo having a statistically signi\ufb01cant and\nnontrivial impact on reducing CRF.116,117,195,196 Future research\nshould acknowledge the signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence of the placebo\neffect and ensure adequate statistical power in study designs.\nLack of intervention standardization is also an issue across\nstudies of many treatment modalities.

From the patient\u2019s perspective, additional\nhurdles emerge. During brief health consultations, the pri-\nority often centers on cancer control, leaving limited room\nfor comprehensive fatigue discussions.198 Patients may lack\nthe stamina for extended visits solely dedicated to fatigue\nmanagement. Furthermore, health care practitioners\u2019 atti-\ntudes toward fatigue\u2014whether dismissive or empathetic\u2014\nshape patient experiences and willingness to engage in\ndialogue.197-199 When patients speak, all too often, clinicians\ninterrupt them after only a few seconds.200\nTo bridge these gaps, fostering open communication be-\ncomes paramount. Patients should be encouraged to artic-\nulate their fatigue symptoms, describing severity, temporal\npatterns, and the impact on daily life. Active listening by\nclinicians allows tailoring of interventions to individual\nneeds. Emphasizing shared decision making and realistic\nexpectations\u2014coupled\nwith\nongoing\ncommunication\u2014\nforms the bedrock of effective CRF management.
