Therefore, breast cancer patients who experience\ntreatment-related early menopause may be at higher risk for heart\ndisease than age-matched women in the general population. The\nchemotherapeutic agents epirubicin and doxorubicin are associated\nwith a low but real risk of cardiomyopathy72; similarly, trastuzumab\nis associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction, most\nnotably when given concomitantly or after an anthracycline, as has\nbeen detailed by the European Society for Medical Oncology.73\nAromatase inhibitors can raise cholesterol levels74,75 and the risk\nof diabetes.

Therefore, breast cancer patients who experience\ntreatment-related early menopause may be at higher risk for heart\ndisease than age-matched women in the general population.

Breast cancer survivors also need to be counseled on health\npromotion strategies to minimize and mitigate long-term and late\neffects, to ameliorate comorbid health conditions, and to potentially\nincrease survival.\nTo clarify the roles of all clinicians working with cancer survivors,\nwe concur with the Institute of Medicine that survivors and primary\ncare clinicians should receive a survivorship care plan that includes a\nconcise summary of treatment as well as a clinical follow-up care plan.\nIdeally, this plan would be constructed in partnership with the sur-\nvivor to identify and prioritize goals for survivorship care and would\nbe communicated to the patient to ensure their understanding of\nindividual risks; recommended tests, procedures, and supportive care\nstrategies; and how to optimize wellness. Survivorship care should be\ncoordinated with treating cancer specialists.\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nIn addition to this guideline, tools and resources are available to assist\nprimary care clinicians in implementing these recommendations.

Glu-\ncocorticoid effects on bone are also large, but a number of\nstudies suggest that the effects of short-term regimens used\nin most cancer treatments are small or rapidly reversible.\nLong-term use (eg, 3 or more months) of glucocorticoid\ndoses equivalent to prednisone greater than 2.5 mg per day\nor higher confer high fracture risk, however, and evaluation\nand treatment of such patients should follow guidelines that\nare speci\ufb01cally focused on them.79\nData are particularly limited regarding the appropriate in-\nterval between bone density evaluations among patients\nwith cancer."}, "hash": "fa5ac6b7c8ec709996f7b14532ea9158dea4fa439e0783fbf781346b433dacf0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Consideration of calcium and vitamin D dietary and supplement intake is recommended to manage bone health, especially for those at risk of osteoporosis.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 152, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c0db75c-c84f-4b45-bf27-79a5c9d014e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c0db75c-c84f-4b45-bf27-79a5c9d014e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_number": 13, "doc_title": "Management of Osteoporosis in Survivors of Adult Cancers With Nonmetastatic Disease: ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline", "keywords": ["calcium", "vitamin D", "exercise", "smoking cessation", "alcohol consumption"], "information_category": "Lifestyle and behavior recommendations for cancer survivors", "source": "Guidelines outside of cancer, such as that\nfrom the International Society for Clinical Densitometry,80\nemphasize using both baseline bone density and expected\nlosses to make recommendations for intervals between\ntests.

The ASCO Expert Panel did\nnot further update the American College of Rheumatology\u2019s\nsystematic review and supports their recommendations for\nthe management of patients on long-term glucocorticoids.\nDISCUSSION\nIncreasing physical activity, strength training, training to\nprevent falls, smoking cessation, decreasing alcohol con-\nsumption, and adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D are\nthe cornerstones of overall and bone health in survivors of\ncancer. The Expert Panel cannot overstate the importance of\nthese factors. DXA screening should occur at least every\n2 years and once per year in some cases, if clinically in-\ndicated. The decision to treat with BMA should be guided by\nthe estimated fracture risk using a guide such as FRAX\ncalculator. FRAX may underestimate the true fracture risk for\nthose beginning high-risk treatment, so those survivors of\ncancer receiving ADT, AI, GnRH agonists, or chronic glu-\ncocorticoids or undergoing allogenic transplantation, or\nthose who develop CIOF should be deemed to have sec-\nondary osteoporosis when using FRAX.

This may include the imple-\nmentation of interventions that target modi\ufb01able risk fac-\ntors, such as physical activity programs, as well as the\nprovision of supportive care services, such as counseling and\nsocial support groups, to address the physical, emotional,\nand psychological impact of cancer and its treatment.\nLIMITATION OF THE RESEARCH AND FUTURE RESEARCH\nStudies investigating the management of fatigue in patients\nwith cancer pose numerous challenges. Notably, the literature\nincludes many studies on interventions for patients experi-\nencing subthreshold levels of fatigue, making it challenging to\nobserve treatment effects because of \ufb02oor effects. Under-\npowered trials, unable to detect differences between treatment\nand control groups, are also a signi\ufb01cant concern. Moreover,\nplacebo effects cannot be discounted. Recent clinical trials and\nreviews have demonstrated the bene\ufb01cial effect of placebo,\n2480 | \u00a9 2024 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\nBower et al\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 68.180.32.21 on October 2, 2024 from 068.180.032.021\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Although the committee upholds the\nde\ufb01nition advanced by the National Coalition for Cancer Survi-\nvorship, which considers anyone to be a survivor from the moment\nof diagnosis through the rest of their life, this would have diluted\nthe primary aim of this guideline, which is to explore pain as a later\nphenomenon of cancer and its treatment.

Of course, this is good news,\nbut it sometimes comes at a cost. Put simply, chronic pain from\ntreatment-related adverse effects can signi\ufb01cantly affect the quality\nof life of many cancer survivors for years after initial treatment\nstops. Chronic pain can develop from a variety of sources: pe-\nripheral neuropathy, muscle or bone pain, surgery, radiation, and\nother conditions. Comorbidity with other conditions or syn-\ndromes can make assessing chronic pain more dif\ufb01cult. Because\npost-treatment pain is so complicated, good communication be-\ntween patients and their medical providers is essential. Cancer\nsurvivors are more than their cancer history or their pain; they are\nindividuals with unique needs. They may have varying capacities to\ndeal with a great deal of information that can sometimes be\noverwhelming. Just as no two cancers are alike, patients experience\npain differently. Some patients may even be reluctant to discuss\ntheir pain, seeing it as a sign of weakness or fearing a recurrence;\nsome may see it an expected and untreatable complication of their\ncancer treatment. That is why a pain assessment is recommended at\nevery visit. In teasing out how they are coping, clinicians need to\nask patients how chronic pain is affecting them and suggest how\nthey can work together to better manage their symptoms and\nimprove their quality of life. Survivors who understand all aspects\nof their pain treatment plan (and their role in it) may have a better\noverall outcome.\nHealth Disparities\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert\nrecommendations on best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to health care. Lack of access\nbecause of geographic location and distance from appropriate\ntreatment facilities is an ongoing concern for many patients.

A systematic review of evidence\npublished from 2013-2021 was conducted.\nRESULTS The evidence base consisted of 17 systematic reviews 6 meta analyses (nine for psychosocial in-\nterventions, four for physical exercise, three for mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR], and one for\npharmacologic interventions), and an additional 44 randomized controlled trials. Psychological, educational,\nand psychosocial interventions led to improvements in depression and anxiety. Evidence for pharmacologic\nmanagement of depression and anxiety in cancer survivors was inconsistent. The lack of inclusion of survivors\nfrom minoritized groups was noted and identi\ufb01ed as an important consideration to provide high-quality care for\nethnic minority populations.\nRECOMMENDATIONS It is recommended to use a stepped-care model, that is, provide the most effective and\nleast resource-intensive intervention based on symptom severity. All oncology patients should be offered\neducation regarding depression and anxiety. For patients with moderate symptoms of depression, clinicians\nshould offer cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), behavioral activation (BA), MBSR, structured physical activity, or\nempirically supported psychosocial interventions. For patients with moderate symptoms of anxiety, clinicians\nshould offer CBT, BA, structured physical activity, acceptance and commitment therapy, or psychosocial\ninterventions. For patients with severe symptoms of depression or anxiety, clinicians should offer cognitive\ntherapy, BA, CBT, MBSR, or interpersonal therapy."}}, "0eaa71d6-cf9f-4105-8a56-73008af57eec": {"node_ids": ["6f78484a-c739-4cdf-9637-5c4db65fcad1"], "metadata": {"page_number": 7, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["treatment costs", "financial guidance", "support services"], "information_category": "Lifestyle and behavior recommendations for cancer survivors", "source": "B\nSupportive care services for all patients, as available and appropriate\nProvide education and information (verbal plus any relevant materials) for the patient and family about\n  Normalcy of stress in the context of cancer\n  Sources of informational support/resources re: disease/treatment (eg, patient materials\u2019 reliable internet sites)\n  Specific information/strategies regarding any/all of the following:\n      Stress reduction (eg, progressive muscle relaxation)\n      Fatigue\n      Sleep problems (eg, CBT for insomnia, CBTi)\n  Information regarding anticipated treatment costs\n  Availability of financial guidance and support services\n  Any support services (eg, professionally led groups, informational lectures, volunteer organizations) for the patient and\n    family at the institution or in the community\n  Information on nutrition/dietary support services\nCare Map\u2014Depression in Adults With Cancer\nOffer referral to support\n  services\nIntervention options (low intensity)\n  Information plus any of the following:\n   Cognitive therapy or cognitive behavior therapy\n     (internet, telehealth, group)\n    Behavioral activation\n    Structured physical activity/exercise\n    Mindfulness-based stress reduction, with follow-up\n    Psychosocial interventions with empirically\n      supported components (eg, relaxation, problem\n      solving) (Group treatment)\nIntervention options (high intensity)\n  Cognitive therapy or cognitive behavior\n    therapy\n  Behavioral activation\n  Mindfulness-based stress reduction\n  Interpersonal therapy\n  Pharmacologic (only considered following\n    previous therapies if remission has not\n    occurred)\n      Individual treatment is recommended\nPsychological (individual)\n  Delivered by licensed mental health professionals using relevant treatment manuals that include some or all\n    of the following content:  cognitive change, behavioral activation, biobehavioral strategies, education, and/or\n    relaxation strategies.\n  Relapse prevention additions are also important.\n  Monitor for efficacy.\n  Behavioral couples\u2019 therapy can be considered for people with a regular partner and when the relationship\n    may contribute to the development or maintenance of depression.\nPharmacologic\n  Physician-prescribed antidepressants, with choice informed by side-effect profiles, interactions, response,\n    patient age, and preference.\n  Consider interventions with short-term duration.\n  Monitor regularly for adherence, side effects, and adverse events."}}, "59acb200-b041-41bd-a846-e6294f409bca": {"node_ids": ["b32837a9-77fd-4fcc-a318-ab73c702fac0"], "metadata": {"page_number": 7, "doc_title": "Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO Guideline Update", "keywords": ["compliance", "treatment adherence", "motivation", "psychological treatment"], "information_category": "Lifestyle and behavior recommendations for cancer survivors", "source": "Consider interventions with short-term duration.\n  Monitor regularly for adherence, side effects, and adverse events.\nPsychosocial (group)\n  Structured, led by licensed mental health professional, with topics such as stress reduction, positive coping\n    (seeking information, problem-solving, assertive communication), enhancing social support from\n    friends/family, coping with physical symptoms (eg, fatigue, sexual dysfunction) and bodily changes, and\n    health behavior change (diet, activity level, tobacco use).\n  Consider for individual treatment should depressive symptoms not remit or worsen.\nIt is common for persons with depressive symptoms to lack the motivation necessary to follow through on referrals and/or to comply with treatment\n  recommendations.

The pathognomic GAD symptom, ie, multiple excessive worries, may\npresent as concerns or fears. Whereas cancer worries may be common for many, GAD worry or fear may be disproportionate to actual cancer-related\nrisk (eg, excessive fear of recurrence, worry about multiple symptoms or symptoms not associated with current disease or treatments). Importantly, an\nindividual with GAD has worries about a range of other, noncancer topics and areas of his/her life.\nIt is important to determine the associated home, relationship, social, or occupational impairments, if any, and the duration of anxiety-related symptoms.\nAs noted above, problem checklists can be used."}}, "a9ef97f0-1968-4883-9e0c-eef4bbf8657b": {"node_ids": ["1df6d4d4-8330-4c19-98e0-e23a3ae9461e"], "metadata": {"page_number": 1, "doc_title": "American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline", "keywords": ["post-treatment symptoms", "quality of life", "endocrine therapy", "monitoring"], "information_category": "Lifestyle and behavior recommendations for cancer survivors", "source": "A systematic review of the literature was conducted using\nPubMed through April 2015.

Furthermore, ASCO recently endorsed the American\nCancer Society (ACS) guideline on prostate cancer survivorship.16 The\nACS/ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline builds on prior\nguidelines by providing comprehensive, holistic recommendations\nspeci\ufb01c to post-treatment breast cancer clinical care to help primary\ncare clinicians better manage potential long-term and late effects and\nto provide timely and appropriate screening and surveillance to\nimprove the overall health and QoL of breast cancer survivors.\nThis year, approximately 231,840 women will be newly\ndiagnosed with breast cancer, and an estimated 3.1 million breast\ncancer survivors are alive in the United States.17 The median age at\ndiagnosis is 61 years, and 43% are older than 65 years at diagnosis;\nthus, cancer survivorship must be managed in coordination with\ncomorbidities associated with aging.1 Approximately 61% will have\nlocalized disease, for which survival outcomes are highest (5-year\nrelative survival rates: 99% for localized-stage breast cancer v 25%\nfor distant-stage breast cancer).2\nBreast cancer treatment depends on the stage at diagnosis, the\nsize and location of the tumor, and tumor characteristics."}}, "f56c6b4e-3dd5-4095-98f0-3a7e3fb58950": {"node_ids": ["7f84b721-057d-4734-b9cf-aedd236ba972"], "metadata": {"page_number": 2, "doc_title": "American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline", "keywords": ["health promotion", "lifestyle changes", "behavior changes"], "information_category": "Lifestyle and behavior recommendations for cancer survivors", "source": "The\noverarching goals of The Survivorship Center are to improve\nindividual-level, system-level, and policy-level post-treatment survi-\nvorship clinical care, to develop resources to help survivors achieve\noptimal health and QoL, as well as to highlight the importance of post-\ntreatment survivorship as a public health issue.8 A strategic partnership\nwith ASCO was formed to optimize consistent, evidence-based rec-\nommendations for survivorship care in patients with breast cancer.\nGUIDELINE QUESTIONS\nThe clinical practice guideline addresses 5 key areas of breast cancer\nsurvivorship to provide recommendations on best practice in the\nmanagement of adult women after breast cancer treatment,\nfocusing on the role of primary care clinicians and other clinicians\nwho care for post-treatment breast cancer survivors.

Complementary therapies have been\nstudied, and some have been found to be minimally effective.171\nHEALTH PROMOTION\nWomen with breast cancer are likely to have long-term survival.1\nThus, enhancing the length and quality of life is an important goal in\nthe care of patients with breast cancer and in creating a survivorship\ncare plan (see Recommendations 4.1 and 5.1 for more information\non survivorship care plans)."}}, "c69c569d-07b3-4c6e-afc5-b15913eb3cb7": {"node_ids": ["b5effd18-8a93-43d5-99b7-24f0a17f5a88"], "metadata": {"page_number": 16, "doc_title": "American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline", "keywords": ["treatment summaries", "survivorship care plans", "implementation", "primary care clinicians"], "information_category": "Lifestyle and behavior recommendations for cancer survivors", "source": "Healthy behaviors are paramount to\nreducing the risk of second cancers, comorbidities, obesity, and\npossibly recurrence; improving prognosis; ameliorating cancer-\nrelated symptoms172-177; and decreasing the risk of mortality.174-184\nTable 7 outlines this information, including physical activity,\nnutrition, and smoking cessation recommendations for breast cancer\nsurvivorship, incorporating existing ACS nutrition and physical\nactivity recommendations23 (Table 7: Health Promotion Guidelines).\nInformation\nRecommendation 4.1.

Few\nstudies have evaluated the ef\ufb01cacy of preventive strategies before\ninitiation of cancer therapy. As such, any recommendation re-\ngarding prevention strategies before initiation of cancer-directed\ntherapy is based on good clinical judgment and expert consensus.\nTherefore, we recommend avoidance or minimizing the use of\npotentially cardiotoxic therapies in individuals at moderate to high\nrisk if established alternatives exist that would not compromise\ncancer-speci\ufb01c outcomes. Moreover, patients planning to receive\npotentially cardiotoxic therapies should undergo a comprehensive\nassessment that includes a history and physical examination,\nscreening for cardiovascular risk factors, and an echocardiogram to\nensure adequate cardiac function before initiation of potentially\ncardiotoxic therapy. These recommendations are based on the\nconsistent epidemiologic evidence33,35,38,39,43,45,47,49,53-55,65,110,119\nthat pretreatment cardiovascular disease risk status is an important\nprognosticator of future cardiac dysfunction risk.\nClinical Question 3: Which preventive strategies are\neffective in minimizing risk during the administration of\npotentially cardiotoxic cancer therapy?\nRecommendation 3.1.

It is important for oncologists and advanced care\npractitioners to initiate the discussion regarding the potential for\ncardiac dysfunction in individuals in whom the risk is suf\ufb01ciently\nhigh before starting therapy. Hearing about potential complications\nfrom therapy early in the cancer journey can be dif\ufb01cult for patients\nwith cancer to process, because their primary focus is surviving their\nmalignancy. However, clear provider-patient communication may\nlead to appropriate monitoring and implementation of potential\npreventive strategies. A baseline cardiac dysfunction risk assessment\nby the oncology care provider(s) is important before therapy. For\nhigh-risk patients, a tailored and detailed plan for cardiac moni-\ntoring throughout treatment and beyond should also be established.\nPatients also need to be advised that cardiac dysfunction can be\na progressive disorder and may initially be asymptomatic; therefore,\nearly and late warning signs and symptoms should be discussed and\nreported to the primary oncology team or to a cardiologist. A heart-\nhealthy lifestyle, including the role of diet and exercise, should be\ndiscussed with all patients with cancer before and after completion\nof their cancer therapy.\nHEALTH DISPARITIES\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert rec-\nommendations on the best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to medical care.

The two largest groups of sur-\nvivors are women with early-stage breast cancers and\nmen with nonmetastatic prostate cancers (NMPC),\nand these patients frequently have received cancer\ntreatments that cause particularly high rates of bone\nloss. It is the coalescence of survivors of cancer\nand osteoporosis, a health problem of near-epidemic\nproportion that forms the underlying rationale for this\nevidence-based guideline.\nThe prevalence of osteoporosis worldwide is estimated\nat 200 million. At least 40% of postmenopausal\nwomen and 15% to 30% of men will experience\na fragility fracture.2 Osteoporosis can be thought of as\nan equation.3 The equation, simply stated, is the peak\nbone mass achieved by age 30 years minus the on-\ngoing losses related to age and menopause. Osteoporosis\nis a complex genetic disease4,5 and no genetic markers for\neither low peak bone mass or high later losses are yet being\nmeasured routinely in clinical settings; however, family\nhistory, especially of hip fracture, is an important predictor\nof fractures, as is advancing age.6 Lifestyle factors also\naffect bone loss. For example, cigarette smoking and ex-\ncessive alcohol consumption, as well as non\u2013cancer-\nspeci\ufb01c medications (eg, glucocorticoids) promote bone\nloss (Table 1).\nIn patients with nonmetastatic cancer, both the dis-\nease itself, through an association with increased local\nand systemic in\ufb02ammation, and its treatment can pose\nchallenges to skeletal integrity."}}, "ce36ecbf-8cdc-4c44-900c-08eb6c465370": {"node_ids": ["4ec46eed-5e49-48e0-88b1-74aa410dafd2"], "metadata": {"page_number": 2, "doc_title": "Management of Osteoporosis in Survivors of Adult Cancers With Nonmetastatic Disease: ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline", "keywords": ["advanced age", "cigarette smoking", "alcohol consumption", "impaired mobility"], "information_category": "Lifestyle and behavior recommendations for cancer survivors", "source": "THE BOTTOM LINE\nManagement of Osteoporosis in Survivors of Adult Cancers With Nonmetastatic Disease: ASCO Clinical Practice\nGuideline\nGuideline Questions\n1.

Exercise, cognitive behavioral\ntherapy (CBT), and mindfulness-based programs led to improvements in\nCRF both during and after the completion of cancer treatment. Tai chi,\nqigong, and American ginseng showed bene\ufb01ts during treatment, whereas\nyoga, acupressure, and moxibustion helped to manage CRF after com-\npletion of treatment. Use of other dietary supplements did not improve CRF\nduring or after cancer treatment. In patients at the end of life, CBT and\ncorticosteroids showed bene\ufb01ts. Certainty and quality of evidence were low\nto moderate for CRF management interventions.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nClinicians should recommend exercise, CBT, mindfulness-based programs,\nand tai chi or qigong to reduce the severity of fatigue during cancer treatment.\nPsychoeducation and American ginseng may be recommended in adults un-\ndergoing cancer treatment. For survivors after completion of treatment, cli-\nnicians should recommend exercise, CBT, and mindfulness-based programs;\nin particular, CBT and mindfulness-based programs have shown ef\ufb01cacy for\nmanaging moderate to severe fatigue after treatment. Yoga, acupressure, and\nmoxibustion may also be recommended. Patients at the end of life may be\noffered CBT and corticosteroids. Clinicians should not recommend L-carnitine,\nantidepressants, wakefulness agents, or routinely recommend psychostimu-\nlants to manage symptoms of CRF.

Four trials compared different exercise\ninterventions (high v low intensity, aerobic v resistance v\ncombination),12,15,19,25 and 13 trials compared exercise to a\nwaitlist or attention control.11,13-18,20-24,27 In examining the\ntrials that investigated the effects of exercise versus control\nconditions, nine out of the 13 trials demonstrated signi\ufb01cant\nbene\ufb01ts of the exercise interventions. Trials had sample\nsizes ranging from 50 to 577 patients and tested exercise\nmodalities, including home-based walking, combined aer-\nobic and resistance exercises, and resistance-only inter-\nventions. Intervention modalities also differed, including\nhome-based unsupervised, in-person supervised, and re-\nmotely supervised exercise programs. Risk of bias ranged\nfrom low to high in the 17 trials, with an overall risk of bias\nassessed as intermediate.\nOf the four trials comparing different exercise modalities or\nintensities, with sample sizes that ranged from 54 to 577, there\nwere largely no signi\ufb01cant differences in the impact of the\ndifferent exercise interventions on fatigue, making it dif\ufb01cult\nto determine if one form of exercise provides superior bene\ufb01t in\nTABLE 3.

Notably, the literature\nincludes many studies on interventions for patients experi-\nencing subthreshold levels of fatigue, making it challenging to\nobserve treatment effects because of \ufb02oor effects. Under-\npowered trials, unable to detect differences between treatment\nand control groups, are also a signi\ufb01cant concern. Moreover,\nplacebo effects cannot be discounted. Recent clinical trials and\nreviews have demonstrated the bene\ufb01cial effect of placebo,\n2480 | \u00a9 2024 by American Society of Clinical Oncology\nBower et al\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 68.180.32.21 on October 2, 2024 from 068.180.032.021\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

However, optimal use of imaging to detect\ndisease progression remains unclearly de\ufb01ned for this population. An expert working group con-\nvened to consider available evidence and clinical experience and develop recommendations for\nfollow-up imaging after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT). Voting on agree-\nment was conducted anonymously via online survey. Follow-up imaging was recommended for\nall suitable patients after CRT completion regardless of whether durvalumab is received. Imaging\nshould occur every 3 months in Year 1, at least every 6 months in Year 2, and at least every 12 months\nin Years 3\u20135. Contrast computed tomography was preferred; routine brain imaging was not rec-\nommended for asymptomatic patients. The medical oncologist should follow-up during Year 1 of\ndurvalumab therapy, with radiation oncologist involvement if pneumonitis is suspected; medical\nand radiation oncologists can subsequently alternate follow-up. Some patients can transition to the\nfamily physician/community primary care team at the end of Year 2. In Years 1\u20135, patients should re-\nceive information regarding smoking cessation, comorbidity management, vaccinations, and general\nfollow-up care. These recommendations provide guidance on follow-up imaging for patients with\nstage III unresectable NSCLC whether or not they receive durvalumab consolidation therapy.\nKeywords: non-small cell lung cancer; stage III; follow-up imaging; guidelines; durvalumab\n1. Introduction\nIn 2020, lung cancer was the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy, with\nmore than 2.2 million cases reported worldwide [1]. The disease was also the leading\ncause of cancer-related mortality, contributing to more than 1.7 million deaths globally [1].\nCurr.

Detailed Recommendations\nCLINICAL QUESTION 1: What timepoint should be used as a reference for initiation\nof imaging?\nRecommendation 1.1: For all patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC, imag-\ning should be performed after completion of CRT, regardless of whether durvalumab\nis received.\nClinical Rationale: Patients with stage III, unresectable NSCLC have the highest risk\nof disease relapse in the \ufb01rst year after completion of CRT independent of whether durval-\numab consolidation therapy is received [13]. In the PACIFIC trial, rates of progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) were 55.7% with CRT + durvalumab and 34.5% with CRT alone at one year\nof follow-up, 45.0% and 25.1% at two years, 39.7% and 20.8% at three years, 35.0% and\n19.9% at four years, and 33.1% and 19.0% at \ufb01ve years (Figure 1) [13].

Furthermore, the comprehensive care of these individuals\nshould address both cancer-related and general care needs. These needs include not only\nongoing surveillance for disease recurrence or progression, but also monitoring and man-\nagement of psychosocial issues and chronic medical conditions, general health promotion,\nand disease prevention [14]. Community primary care teams should provide counselling\non the importance of smoking cessation and vaccinations for in\ufb02uenza, Streptococcus\npneumoniae, and COVID-19, among others. The implications of common comorbidities,\nsuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, should also be discussed.\nThroughout the course of treatment and follow-up of patients with stage III unre-\nsectable NSCLC, the family physician/community primary care team should be kept in-\nformed of the results of all clinical assessments and continue to provide care for non-cancer\nhealth, family, and psychosocial concerns. All patients should receive a summary of key\nhealth-related items for consideration and follow-up over the course of their disease. This\nsummary should include information regarding the potential impact of cancer therapy on\ntheir health, including current comorbidities and the risk of new long-term complications.\n4. Conclusions\nThe favorable \ufb01ve-year survival results of the PACIFIC trial of durvalumab have\nprompted reconsideration of best follow-up imaging practices for patients with stage III\nunresectable NSCLC.
