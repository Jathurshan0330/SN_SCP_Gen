A\ntotal of 3 systematic reviews, 2 with meta-analyses, and 28 primary trials for prevention of CIPN in addition to 14\nprimary trials related to treatment of established CIPN, are included in this update.\nRECOMMENDATIONS The identi\ufb01ed data recon\ufb01rmed that no agents are recommended for the prevention of\nCIPN. The use of acetyl-L-carnitine for the prevention of CIPN in patients with cancer should be discouraged.\nFurthermore, clinicians should assess the appropriateness of dose delaying, dose reduction, substitutions, or\nstopping chemotherapy in patients who develop intolerable neuropathy and/or functional impairment.\nDuloxetine is the only agent that has appropriate evidence to support its use for patients with established painful\nCIPN.

In-\nconsistent measurement methods have often been\nused to characterize the variations in neuropathy\ncaused by different chemotherapy drugs. However,\nthe same validated neuropathy measurement tools\nhave been recently used in several clinical studies. The\ndata arising from these studies allow for a more de-\ntailed comparison of neuropathy clinical manifesta-\ntions caused by two of the most prominent neurotoxic\nchemotherapy agents, paclitaxel and oxaliplatin.1-4\nBoth oxaliplatin and paclitaxel cause acute neuropathy.\nOxaliplatin-induced acute neuropathy is characterized\nby cold sensitivity, throat discomfort, discomfort swal-\nlowing cold liquids, and muscle cramps. Although some\nof these symptoms can occur within the time of drug\ninfusion, their severity usually peaks 2 to 3 days after\neach dose of oxaliplatin. With subsequent treatment\ncycles, symptom severities double in magnitude over\nthat seen for the \ufb01rst treatment cycle. Oxaliplatin-\ninduced acute neuropathy does not return to base-\nline between cycles when oxaliplatin is administered\nonce every 2 weeks. There is no good information to\ndelineate how long acute symptoms last after the last\ndose of oxaliplatin.\nPaclitaxel also frequently causes a pain syndrome that\noccurs in the days following each dose.

Outcomes of interest included symptom relief, pain\nintensity, quality of life, functional outcomes, adverse events, misuse or diversion, and risk as-\nsessment or mitigation.\nResults\nA total of 63 studies met eligibility criteria and compose the evidentiary basis for the recom-\nmendations. Studies tended to be heterogeneous in terms of quality, size, and populations. Primary\noutcomes also varied across the studies, and in most cases, were not directly comparable because\nof different outcomes, measurements, and instruments used at different time points. Because of\na paucity of high-quality evidence, many recommendations are based on expert consensus.\nRecommendations\nClinicians should screen for pain at each encounter. Recurrent disease, second malignancy, or late-\nonset treatment effects in any patient who reports new-onset pain should be evaluated, treated, and\nmonitored. Clinicians should determine the need for other health professionals to provide compre-\nhensive pain management care in patients with complex needs. Systemic nonopioid analgesics and\nadjuvant analgesics may be prescribed to relieve chronic pain and/or to improve function. Clinicians\nmay prescribe a trial of opioids in carefully selected patients with cancer who do not respond to more\nconservative management and who continue to experience distress or functional impairment. Risks of\nadverse effects of opioids should be assessed. Clinicians should clearly understand terminology such\nas tolerance, dependence, abuse, and addiction as it relates to the use of opioids and should in-\ncorporate universal precautions to minimize abuse, addiction, and adverse consequences.

Put simply, chronic pain from\ntreatment-related adverse effects can signi\ufb01cantly affect the quality\nof life of many cancer survivors for years after initial treatment\nstops. Chronic pain can develop from a variety of sources: pe-\nripheral neuropathy, muscle or bone pain, surgery, radiation, and\nother conditions. Comorbidity with other conditions or syn-\ndromes can make assessing chronic pain more dif\ufb01cult. Because\npost-treatment pain is so complicated, good communication be-\ntween patients and their medical providers is essential. Cancer\nsurvivors are more than their cancer history or their pain; they are\nindividuals with unique needs. They may have varying capacities to\ndeal with a great deal of information that can sometimes be\noverwhelming. Just as no two cancers are alike, patients experience\npain differently. Some patients may even be reluctant to discuss\ntheir pain, seeing it as a sign of weakness or fearing a recurrence;\nsome may see it an expected and untreatable complication of their\ncancer treatment. That is why a pain assessment is recommended at\nevery visit. In teasing out how they are coping, clinicians need to\nask patients how chronic pain is affecting them and suggest how\nthey can work together to better manage their symptoms and\nimprove their quality of life. Survivors who understand all aspects\nof their pain treatment plan (and their role in it) may have a better\noverall outcome.\nHealth Disparities\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert\nrecommendations on best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to health care. Lack of access\nbecause of geographic location and distance from appropriate\ntreatment facilities is an ongoing concern for many patients.

The\n12-month prevalence rate for any mental disorder is\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher in patients with cancer compared\nwith general population controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.28;\n95% CI, 1.14 to 1.45).4 Psychological symptoms\namong patients with cancer are under-recognized and\nundertreated.5,6 Symptoms may be trivialized as a\nnormal reaction to cancer diagnosis, or interpreted as\nsecondary to physical symptoms. In an effort to address\nthis problem, American Society of Clinical Oncology\n(ASCO) in 20147 published recommendations for\nroutine screening using validated, published measures\nto provide guidance for referral and treatment.\nStill, identi\ufb01cation and treatment of patients with\ncancer with comorbid psychiatric disorders, either pre-\nexisting or newly arising, remains imperative.

It is the view of the Expert Panel\nthat health care providers and health care system decision makers should be guided by these recommendations. However,\nthe authors acknowledge that not all recommended interventions for management of depression and/or anxiety in survivors of\nadult cancer are available in resource-limited environments. When services are not available, clinicians should opt for other\naccessible interventions.\nRecommendations\nPlease refer to ASCO\u2019s 2014 recommendations on screening and assessment (also available in Appendix Table A1 [online\nonly]).\nGeneral Management Principles\nRecommendation 1.1.

Therefore, in\nconsideration of recommended care for the target index condition,\nclinicians should review all other chronic conditions present in the\npatient and take those conditions into account when formulating\nthe treatment and follow-up plan.\nIn light of these considerations, practice guidelines should\nprovide information on how to apply the recommendations for\npatients with MCCs, perhaps as a qualifying statement for rec-\nommended care. This may mean that some or all of the recom-\nmended care options are modi\ufb01ed or not applied, as determined by\nbest practice in consideration of any MCCs.\nEXTERNAL REVIEW\nAfter \ufb01nalization by the workgroup, the guideline was sent to addi-\ntional internal experts (ACS and ASCO) and external experts for review\nand comment before submission for publication.

Barriers to implementation include the need to increase\nawareness of the guideline recommendations among front-line\npractitioners and survivors of cancer and caregivers and also to\nprovide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The\nguideline Bottom Line Box (Table 1) was designed to facilitate the\nimplementation of recommendations. This guideline will be dis-\ntributed widely through the ASCO Practice Guideline Implementa-\ntion Network. ACS/ASCO guidelines are posted on the ACS and\nASCO websites. This joint ACS-ASCO guideline is published in both\nCA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and in Journal of Clinical Oncology.\nSUMMARY\nBreast cancer survivors face potentially signi\ufb01cant impacts of cancer\nand its treatment and deserve high-quality, comprehensive, coor-\ndinated clinical follow-up care.

Breast cancer survivors also need to be counseled on health\npromotion strategies to minimize and mitigate long-term and late\neffects, to ameliorate comorbid health conditions, and to potentially\nincrease survival.\nTo clarify the roles of all clinicians working with cancer survivors,\nwe concur with the Institute of Medicine that survivors and primary\ncare clinicians should receive a survivorship care plan that includes a\nconcise summary of treatment as well as a clinical follow-up care plan.\nIdeally, this plan would be constructed in partnership with the sur-\nvivor to identify and prioritize goals for survivorship care and would\nbe communicated to the patient to ensure their understanding of\nindividual risks; recommended tests, procedures, and supportive care\nstrategies; and how to optimize wellness. Survivorship care should be\ncoordinated with treating cancer specialists.\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\nIn addition to this guideline, tools and resources are available to assist\nprimary care clinicians in implementing these recommendations. CA\noffers a Patient Page (onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21322/\npdf) to help patients understand how to use this guideline to talk to\ntheir doctor about surveillance and screening, symptom management,\nhealthy behaviors, and care coordination.

Heart failure (HF), presenting during or\nafter completion of cancer treatment, is a well-\nrecognized complication impacting survival and\nquality of life. The American College of Cardi-\nology (ACC) and American Heart Association\n(AHA) describe HF as a progressive disorder.2\nThis process begins with risk factors known to be\nassociated with the development of HF, including\nthe toxicity of chemotherapy and/or radiation\n(RT; stage A), and is commonly progressive after\nstructural changes to the heart occur. The initial\nmanifestation may be asymptomatic cardiac\ndysfunction (stage B), which precedes eventual\ndevelopment of overt signs and symptoms (stages\nC and D). In patients with cancer, onset of either\nasymptomatic or symptomatic disease may also\nbe responsible for interruption or discontinuation\nof cancer-directed therapy, potentially reducing\nAuthor af\ufb01liations and support information\n(if applicable) appear at the end of this\narticle.\nPublished at jco.org on December 5,\n2016.\nClinical Practice Guideline Committee\nApproved: June 13, 2016.\nEditor\u2019s note: This American Society of\nClinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice\nGuideline provides recommendations,\nwith comprehensive review and analyses\nof the relevant literature for each\nrecommendation.

Exercise, cognitive behavioral\ntherapy (CBT), and mindfulness-based programs led to improvements in\nCRF both during and after the completion of cancer treatment. Tai chi,\nqigong, and American ginseng showed bene\ufb01ts during treatment, whereas\nyoga, acupressure, and moxibustion helped to manage CRF after com-\npletion of treatment. Use of other dietary supplements did not improve CRF\nduring or after cancer treatment. In patients at the end of life, CBT and\ncorticosteroids showed bene\ufb01ts. Certainty and quality of evidence were low\nto moderate for CRF management interventions.\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nClinicians should recommend exercise, CBT, mindfulness-based programs,\nand tai chi or qigong to reduce the severity of fatigue during cancer treatment.\nPsychoeducation and American ginseng may be recommended in adults un-\ndergoing cancer treatment. For survivors after completion of treatment, cli-\nnicians should recommend exercise, CBT, and mindfulness-based programs;\nin particular, CBT and mindfulness-based programs have shown ef\ufb01cacy for\nmanaging moderate to severe fatigue after treatment. Yoga, acupressure, and\nmoxibustion may also be recommended. Patients at the end of life may be\noffered CBT and corticosteroids. Clinicians should not recommend L-carnitine,\nantidepressants, wakefulness agents, or routinely recommend psychostimu-\nlants to manage symptoms of CRF. There is insuf\ufb01cient evidence to make\nrecommendations for or against other psychosocial, integrative, or pharma-\ncological interventions for the management of fatigue.\nAdditional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines."}}, "a3183d62-e2aa-4aa9-84a7-e8bc1dfc8b08": {"node_ids": ["3c7e0a72-47b1-4f31-ab6e-18805a9e4baf"], "metadata": {"page_number": 1, "doc_title": "Management of Fatigue in Adult Survivors of Cancer: ASCO\u2013Society for Integrative Oncology Guideline Update", "keywords": ["survivorship guidelines", "ASCO", "resources"], "information_category": "References to helpful resources for cancer survivors", "source": "Additional information is available at www.asco.org/survivorship-guidelines.\nACCOMPANYING CONTENT\nAppendix\nData Supplement\nAccepted March 27, 2024\nPublished May 16, 2024\nASCO Evidence-Based Medicine\nCommittee approval: February 23,\n2024\nSociety for Integrative Oncology\nClinical Practice Guideline\nCommittee approval: March 8, 2024\nJ Clin Oncol 42:2456-2487\n\u00a9 2024 by American Society of\nClinical Oncology\nView Online\nArticle\n2456 | Volume 42, Issue 20 | ascopubs.org/journal/jco\nDownloaded from ascopubs.org by 68.180.32.21 on October 2, 2024 from 068.180.032.021\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology.
