A multidisciplinary expert workgroup with expertise in primary care, gyne-\ncology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was formed and tasked with\ndrafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. A total of 1,073 articles met inclusion criteria; and,\nafter full text review, 237 were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance\nfor breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and physical examination,\nand should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do not support performing routine laboratory\ntests or imaging tests in asymptomatic patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care\nclinicians should counsel patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor for post-\ntreatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor for adherence to endocrine\ntherapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are based on current evidence in the literature and\nexpert consensus opinion. Most of the evidence is not suf\ufb01cient to warrant a strong evidence-based\nrecommendation.

The 5 areas\ncovered include 1) surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, 2)\nscreening for second primary cancers, 3) assessment and man-\nagement of physical and psychosocial long-term and late effects of\nbreast cancer and treatment, 4) health promotion, and 5) care\ncoordination and practice implications (Table 1).21-23\nMETHODS\nThe methods used to develop this guideline re\ufb02ect an evolving process that\nwas in\ufb02uenced by ACS screening24 and survivorship16 guidelines.

The purpose of this effort was to develop recommendations for prevention and\nmonitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult-onset cancers.\nMethods\nRecommendations were developed by an expert panel with multidisciplinary representation using\na systematic review (1996 to 2016) of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, observational\nstudies, and clinical experience. Study quality was assessed using established methods, per study\ndesign. The guideline recommendations were crafted in part using the Guidelines Into Decision\nSupport methodology.\nResults\nA total of 104 studies met eligibility criteria and compose the evidentiary basis for the recom-\nmendations. The strength of the recommendations in these guidelines is based on the quality,\namount, and consistency of the evidence and the balance between bene\ufb01ts and harms.\nRecommendations\nIt is important for health care providers to initiate the discussion regarding the potential for cardiac\ndysfunction in individuals in whom the risk is suf\ufb01ciently high before beginning therapy. Certain\nhigher risk populations of survivors of cancer may bene\ufb01t from prevention and screening strategies\nimplemented during cancer-directed therapies.

The purpose of this effort was to develop recommendations for prevention and\nmonitoring of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of adult-onset cancers.\nMethods\nRecommendations were developed by an expert panel with multidisciplinary representation using\na systematic review (1996 to 2016) of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, observational\nstudies, and clinical experience. Study quality was assessed using established methods, per study\ndesign. The guideline recommendations were crafted in part using the Guidelines Into Decision\nSupport methodology.\nResults\nA total of 104 studies met eligibility criteria and compose the evidentiary basis for the recom-\nmendations. The strength of the recommendations in these guidelines is based on the quality,\namount, and consistency of the evidence and the balance between bene\ufb01ts and harms.\nRecommendations\nIt is important for health care providers to initiate the discussion regarding the potential for cardiac\ndysfunction in individuals in whom the risk is suf\ufb01ciently high before beginning therapy. Certain\nhigher risk populations of survivors of cancer may bene\ufb01t from prevention and screening strategies\nimplemented during cancer-directed therapies. Clinical suspicion for cardiac disease should be high\nand threshold for cardiac evaluation should be low in any survivor who has received potentially\ncardiotoxic therapy."}, "hash": "55e8becdd7e89900f30efbed60a5b932d9ff71a1db0be3b83c686d4d27bd04b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Higher risk populations of survivors of cancer may benefit from prevention and screening strategies implemented during cancer-directed therapies.

Note that several medical conditions that are known to cause bone loss are included in risk\nassessment tools, such as FRAX.

This has been demonstrated to\nreduce the risk of fracture; however, when denosumab is\ndiscontinued, there may be an increase in the risk of\nvertebral fractures. The European Calci\ufb01ed Tissue Society\nsuggests the use of a bisphosphonate to reduce this risk\nupon stopping denosumab.129\nThere is good evidence of bene\ufb01t based on gain in BMD\nfrom treatment with ZA. In osteoporosis, the licensed dose\nis 5 mg administered once per year by IV infusion. For\nosteopenia, ZA is dosed 5 mg every 2 years.

However, optimal use of imaging to detect\ndisease progression remains unclearly de\ufb01ned for this population. An expert working group con-\nvened to consider available evidence and clinical experience and develop recommendations for\nfollow-up imaging after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT). Voting on agree-\nment was conducted anonymously via online survey. Follow-up imaging was recommended for\nall suitable patients after CRT completion regardless of whether durvalumab is received. Imaging\nshould occur every 3 months in Year 1, at least every 6 months in Year 2, and at least every 12 months\nin Years 3\u20135. Contrast computed tomography was preferred; routine brain imaging was not rec-\nommended for asymptomatic patients. The medical oncologist should follow-up during Year 1 of\ndurvalumab therapy, with radiation oncologist involvement if pneumonitis is suspected; medical\nand radiation oncologists can subsequently alternate follow-up. Some patients can transition to the\nfamily physician/community primary care team at the end of Year 2. In Years 1\u20135, patients should re-\nceive information regarding smoking cessation, comorbidity management, vaccinations, and general\nfollow-up care.

An expert working group con-\nvened to consider available evidence and clinical experience and develop recommendations for\nfollow-up imaging after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT). Voting on agree-\nment was conducted anonymously via online survey. Follow-up imaging was recommended for\nall suitable patients after CRT completion regardless of whether durvalumab is received. Imaging\nshould occur every 3 months in Year 1, at least every 6 months in Year 2, and at least every 12 months\nin Years 3\u20135.

The implications of common comorbidities,\nsuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, should also be discussed.\nThroughout the course of treatment and follow-up of patients with stage III unre-\nsectable NSCLC, the family physician/community primary care team should be kept in-\nformed of the results of all clinical assessments and continue to provide care for non-cancer\nhealth, family, and psychosocial concerns. All patients should receive a summary of key\nhealth-related items for consideration and follow-up over the course of their disease. This\nsummary should include information regarding the potential impact of cancer therapy on\ntheir health, including current comorbidities and the risk of new long-term complications.\n4.

Therefore, it is\nrecommended that the post-ChT primary tumour volume\nshould be included in the radiation \ufb01eld [II, B].\nNo prospective studies are available on the nodal target\nvolume after ChT. Thus, similar to NSCLC, including the\ninvolved nodal stations before ChT in the target volume is\nrecommended [V, B].\nOmission of elective node irradiation based on CT scans\nshould be used with caution as this strategy may result in\nnodal failures.40 Whether selective node irradiation based\non pre-treatment PETeCT scans can replace elective node\nirradiation has been addressed in two small single-arm\nstudies.41,42 Both studies showed promisingly low nodal\nrecurrence rates."}}, "18a1f94e-70f0-4793-b264-42206d9c24dc": {"node_ids": ["3a47d684-982f-47bc-a1f6-b4c2a6b555d6"], "metadata": {"page_number": 5, "doc_title": "Small-cell lung cancer: ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up&#x2606;", "keywords": ["hippocampal-sparing PCI", "neurocognitive decline", "phase III trial"], "information_category": "Cancer surveillance and other recommended tests for cancer monitoring", "source": "Furthermore, in the CONVERT trial, elec-\ntive node irradiation was omitted in all patients, with half of\nthem staged using PETeCT.29 The incidence of isolated\nnodal failures has not been reported yet but the survival\nresults are the best reported to date.

Therefore, breast cancer patients who experience\ntreatment-related early menopause may be at higher risk for heart\ndisease than age-matched women in the general population.

Caregivers have to cope with the\nphysical aftermath of the survivors\u2019 treatment and manage their\nlong-term and late effects in addition to their own psychosocial\nand physical unmet needs.230 Research has shown that, for 14 to\n24 months after a survivor\u2019s cancer diagnosis, caregivers provide\nconsistent, continuing care involvement231 for patients after breast\ncancer treatment. Successful coordination of care involves not only a\ncomprehensive care team, including primary care clinicians, but also\nthe informal caregivers (usually the spouse/partner/family member)\nwho provide ongoing care to cancer survivors in the home.232\nFurthermore, most caregivers are older adults who are also man-\naging their own health problems. When possible, primary care\nclinicians should include caregivers of breast cancer survivors in all\nfollow-up care appointments to optimize survivor wellness.\nDISCUSSION\nA signi\ufb01cant limitation of this guideline is the limited evidence base\nwith which to provide clear and speci\ufb01c recommendations for the\nprevention and management of long-term and late effects of cancer\nsurvivors. There are few prospective, RCTs testing interventions\namong breast cancer survivors, although studies in breast cancer\nsurvivors dominate the survivorship literature. The majority of the\ncitations characterizing the risk and magnitude of risk of late effects\nand management recommendations relied predominantly on case-\ncontrol studies with fewer than 500 participants and reviews that\ncombined studies with various outcome measures. There were several\ncohort studies that used population-based data to estimate the risk of\nlate effects.\nAnother limitation is the reliance on previous guidelines for\nsurveillance and symptom management. In addition, the literature\nreview was not managed by a clinical epidemiologist because of limited\nresources and, instead, was conducted by project staff and an ACS\nlibrarian. Furthermore, the guidelines did not result directly from the\ndevelopment of speci\ufb01c clinical questions asked before the literature\nreview; and guidelines included in the literature review were not\nevaluated through an instrument such as the Rigor of Development\nsubscale of the Appraisal for Guidelines for Research and Evaluation\n(AGREE II).

Heart failure (HF), presenting during or\nafter completion of cancer treatment, is a well-\nrecognized complication impacting survival and\nquality of life. The American College of Cardi-\nology (ACC) and American Heart Association\n(AHA) describe HF as a progressive disorder.2\nThis process begins with risk factors known to be\nassociated with the development of HF, including\nthe toxicity of chemotherapy and/or radiation\n(RT; stage A), and is commonly progressive after\nstructural changes to the heart occur. The initial\nmanifestation may be asymptomatic cardiac\ndysfunction (stage B), which precedes eventual\ndevelopment of overt signs and symptoms (stages\nC and D). In patients with cancer, onset of either\nasymptomatic or symptomatic disease may also\nbe responsible for interruption or discontinuation\nof cancer-directed therapy, potentially reducing\nAuthor af\ufb01liations and support information\n(if applicable) appear at the end of this\narticle.\nPublished at jco.org on December 5,\n2016.\nClinical Practice Guideline Committee\nApproved: June 13, 2016.\nEditor\u2019s note: This American Society of\nClinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice\nGuideline provides recommendations,\nwith comprehensive review and analyses\nof the relevant literature for each\nrecommendation.

In children (# 21 years old at\ndiagnosis) with cancer, the short- and long-term risk of cardiac\ndysfunction associated with therapeutic exposures, such as\nanthracycline chemotherapy (eg, doxorubicin, epirubicin, dau-\nnorubicin) or use of chest-directed RT. is well described.3 This led\nto the development of evidence-based guidelines to direct sur-\nveillance and prevention of cardiac dysfunction in survivors of\nchildhood cancer.4 The need for comparable screening guidelines\nin survivors of adult-onset cancers is paramount, so that proper\ninterventions can be implemented to avert the risk of cardiac\ndysfunction during and after completion of therapy.\nIn recognition of the increasing need for guidance, the ASCO\nSurvivorship Guidelines Advisory Group recommended this\nguideline topic as a high priority for development, requesting that\nthe emphasis be on cardiac dysfunction (asymptomatic or\nsymptomatic) and that the full scope of therapeutic exposures and\nhealth conditions impacting risk be considered. Although it is well\nestablished that cardiac dysfunction can present as systolic and/or\ndiastolic impairment, there is a paucity of information on the\nincidence and risk factors for diastolic dysfunction in survivors of\nadult-onset cancers. Therefore, the focus of this document is on\nprevention and monitoring of systolic cardiac dysfunction, typi-\ncally detected as low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).\nMoreover, although assessment of coronary artery disease and/or\nother cardiac abnormalities (valvular or pericardial disease) may be\nan important aspect of the comprehensive evaluation of cardiac\nfunction, recommendations for prevention and monitoring of\nthese complications fall outside the scope of this guideline. With\nregard to the medical management of cardiac dysfunction, ref-\nerence will be made to existing treatment guidelines2 as well as\nrelevant studies that address this topic.\nGUIDELINE QUESTIONS\nThis clinical practice guideline addresses the following \ufb01ve over-\narching clinical questions (Fig 1): (1) Which patients with cancer\nare at increased risk for developing cardiac dysfunction?

Expert Panel members had\nexpertise in medical oncology, cardiology, RT oncology, imaging, exercise\nphysiology, cancer prevention, and survivorship (Data Supplement). The\nExpert Panel included representatives from the ACC and AHA. In addition,\na survivor of cancer was included to provide a patient perspective. The\nExpert Panel met in person and via teleconference and corresponded\nthrough e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the\nauthors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline,\nprovide critical review, and \ufb01nalize the guideline recommendations. The\nrecommendations were informed by a systematic review (1996 to 2016) of\nrandomized clinical trials (RCTs), observational studies, and clinical\nexperience. Where evidence was lacking but there was a high level of\nagreement among the panel members (. 80% of panelists), informal\nconsensus was used, as noted with the recommendations. Members of the\nExpert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penulti-\nmate version of the guideline. All ASCO guidelines are ultimately reviewed\nand approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline Committee before\npublication. The guideline also underwent formal review by the ACC and\nAHA and was approved for endorsement by both organizations.\nSystematic Literature Review and Strategy\nASCO guidelines are based on systematic reviews. A protocol for each\nguideline de\ufb01nes the parameters for a targeted literature search including\nrelevant study designs, literature sources, types of reports, and prespeci\ufb01ed\nstudy selection criteria for identi\ufb01ed literature.

There is currently a paucity of information\nregarding the true incidence and natural history of cardiac dys-\nfunction after completion of cancer-directed therapy. Large lon-\ngitudinal studies that have described the incidence of cardiac\ndysfunction have often relied on claims-based administrative\ndata (eg, SEER-Medicare database, national registries).35,43,54,55,68\nHowever, this strategy may overestimate the true incidence of\ncardiac dysfunction because performance of a screening test to rule\nout HF may be falsely interpreted as a diagnosis of HF. In fact,\na recent analysis152 of the accuracy of such claims-based data\nrevealed that the positive predictive value of HF or cardiomyopathy\nas a diagnosis ranged from 42% to 69% in survivors of cancer\ntreated with potentially cardiotoxic therapies.

It is important for oncologists and advanced care\npractitioners to initiate the discussion regarding the potential for\ncardiac dysfunction in individuals in whom the risk is suf\ufb01ciently\nhigh before starting therapy. Hearing about potential complications\nfrom therapy early in the cancer journey can be dif\ufb01cult for patients\nwith cancer to process, because their primary focus is surviving their\nmalignancy. However, clear provider-patient communication may\nlead to appropriate monitoring and implementation of potential\npreventive strategies. A baseline cardiac dysfunction risk assessment\nby the oncology care provider(s) is important before therapy. For\nhigh-risk patients, a tailored and detailed plan for cardiac moni-\ntoring throughout treatment and beyond should also be established.\nPatients also need to be advised that cardiac dysfunction can be\na progressive disorder and may initially be asymptomatic; therefore,\nearly and late warning signs and symptoms should be discussed and\nreported to the primary oncology team or to a cardiologist. A heart-\nhealthy lifestyle, including the role of diet and exercise, should be\ndiscussed with all patients with cancer before and after completion\nof their cancer therapy.\nHEALTH DISPARITIES\nAlthough ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent expert rec-\nommendations on the best practices in disease management to\nprovide the highest level of cancer care, it is important to note that\nmany patients have limited access to medical care.

Clinicians are advised to assess\nfracture risk using established tools. For those patients with substantial risk of osteoporotic fracture, the clinician\nshould obtain a bone mineral density test. The bone health of all patients may bene\ufb01t from optimizing nutrition,\nexercise, and lifestyle.

Note that several medical conditions that are known to cause bone loss are included in risk\nassessment tools, such as FRAX. Clinicians who are attempting to quantify the risk of osteoporosis or osteoporotic\nfracture should also consider additional evaluation or referral if there is a history or clinical suspicion of rarer\nhigh-risk conditions, such as endocrine or metabolic causes of secondary osteoporosis (eg, hypercortisolism,\nhyperparathyroidism, or acromegaly), disorders of collagen metabolism, and high-risk medications (or multiple\nmoderate-risk medications) as described in the text.\nCLINICAL QUESTION 2\nScreening: How should patients with nonmetastatic cancer who are at an increased risk for osteoporotic fractures\nbe screened?\nRecommendation 2.1. Patients with nonmetastatic cancer with one or more risk factors for osteoporotic fracture, as\nper Recommendation 1, should be offered bone mineral density (BMD) testing with central/axial dual-energy x-ray\nabsorptiometry (DXA). In settings in which DXA is not available or technically feasible, other BMD testing (eg,\nquantitative ultrasound or calcaneal DXA) should be offered (Type: evidence based, bene\ufb01ts outweigh harms;\nEvidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: moderate).\nRecommendation 2.2. Patients with nonmetastatic cancer who are prescribed a drug that causes bone loss or\nwhose baseline or subsequent BMD is near the threshold of treatment using FRAX should be offered BMD testing\nevery 2 years, or more frequently if deemed medically necessary, based on the results of BMD testing and expected\nbone loss. Testing should generally not be conducted more than annually (Type: expert panel consensus, relative\nbalance of bene\ufb01ts and harms; Evidence quality: insuf\ufb01cient).\nCLINICAL QUESTION 3\nTreatment: Which patients with nonmetastatic cancer should be treated and which interventions are effective in\nreducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures?\nNonpharmacologic Intervention\nRecommendation 3.1."}}, "78f9d161-01f5-42dd-b0ef-afbd2c6f5540": {"node_ids": ["f13e1101-ccb3-41ff-91f4-13334873c21f"], "metadata": {"page_number": 3, "doc_title": "Management of Osteoporosis in Survivors of Adult Cancers With Nonmetastatic Disease: ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline", "keywords": ["osteoporosis", "bone-modifying agents", "bisphosphonates", "denosumab", "fracture risk"], "information_category": "Cancer surveillance and other recommended tests for cancer monitoring", "source": "Nonpharmacologic Intervention\nRecommendation 3.1. Clinicians should encourage patients to consume a diet with adequate calcium and vitamin\nD.

Clinicians should actively encourage patients to engage in a combination of exercise types,\nincluding balance training, \ufb02exibility or stretching exercises, endurance exercise, and resistance and/or progressive\nstrengthening exercises, to reduce the risk of fractures caused by falls. Whenever possible, exercise should be\ntailored according to the needs and abilities of the individual patient. Patients with an impairment hindering their\ngait or balance should be offered medical rehabilitation (Type: evidence based, bene\ufb01ts outweigh harms; Evidence\nquality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).\nRecommendation 3.3.

For patients with nonmetastatic cancer with osteoporosis (T scores of 22.5 or less in the\nfemoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine) or who are at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures based on clinical\nassessment or risk assessment tools (10-year probability of $ 20% for major osteoporotic fractures or $ 3% for hip\nfractures based on the US-adapted FRAX tool), bone-modifying agents, such as oral bisphosphonates, intravenous\n(IV) bisphosphonates or subcutaneous denosumab at the osteoporosis-indicated dosage, may be offered to reduce\nthe risk of fracture.

Newer BMAs are being evaluated in\nnoncancer populations. For example, romosozumab is an\nantibody that blocks the substance sclerostin, which slows\nthe new formation of bone.160,161 Romosozumab was\napproved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April\n2019 for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal\nwomen who are at high risk for fracture, de\ufb01ned as a history\nof osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture,\nor for patients who have experienced failure with or are\nintolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.

However, optimal use of imaging to detect\ndisease progression remains unclearly de\ufb01ned for this population. An expert working group con-\nvened to consider available evidence and clinical experience and develop recommendations for\nfollow-up imaging after concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT). Voting on agree-\nment was conducted anonymously via online survey. Follow-up imaging was recommended for\nall suitable patients after CRT completion regardless of whether durvalumab is received. Imaging\nshould occur every 3 months in Year 1, at least every 6 months in Year 2, and at least every 12 months\nin Years 3\u20135. Contrast computed tomography was preferred; routine brain imaging was not rec-\nommended for asymptomatic patients. The medical oncologist should follow-up during Year 1 of\ndurvalumab therapy, with radiation oncologist involvement if pneumonitis is suspected; medical\nand radiation oncologists can subsequently alternate follow-up. Some patients can transition to the\nfamily physician/community primary care team at the end of Year 2. In Years 1\u20135, patients should re-\nceive information regarding smoking cessation, comorbidity management, vaccinations, and general\nfollow-up care. These recommendations provide guidance on follow-up imaging for patients with\nstage III unresectable NSCLC whether or not they receive durvalumab consolidation therapy.\nKeywords: non-small cell lung cancer; stage III; follow-up imaging; guidelines; durvalumab\n1. Introduction\nIn 2020, lung cancer was the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy, with\nmore than 2.2 million cases reported worldwide [1].

Oncol. 2023, 30\n3818\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common disease subtype, representing\napproximately 88% of all lung cancer cases [2]. At diagnosis, 19% to 26% of patients\npresent with stage III NSCLC [3,4], a heterogenous stage characterized by a range of\npathophysiological presentations, which, alongside variations in patient characteristics\n(e.g., performance status (PS)), impact decisions related to treatment [5\u20137].\nAfter diagnosis, patients with stage III NSCLC are evaluated for curative-intent ther-\napy, which is typically multi-modal and highly case-speci\ufb01c [5\u20137]. Among the estimated\n87% of patients who present with unresectable disease [3], those who are \ufb01t (Eastern Coop-\nerative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0\u20131), have adequate lung function,\nand have disease that can be radically treated with radiation are recommended to receive\nconcurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) [5\u20139]. For patients\nwho do not progress after CRT, one year of consolidation therapy with the programmed\ndeath-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor durvalumab (IMFINIZI\u00ae) has become the standard of care\nworldwide based on the primary results of the Phase III PACIFIC trial [5,8\u201312]. Long-term\noutcomes from PACIFIC were recently reported, showing that the survival bene\ufb01ts of\nCRT + durvalumab were durable through \ufb01ve years of follow-up (median overall survival\n(mOS): 47.5 vs. 29.1 months with CRT alone; 5-year OS: 42.9% vs. 33.4%) [13].\nThe favorable long-term results of the PACIFIC trial have raised questions regarding\noptimal follow-up practices for patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC who receive\ntreatment with CRT and durvalumab. Patient follow-up typically involves medical history,\nphysical examination, radiographic imaging (usually computed tomography [CT]), and in\nsome cases, serum biomarker evaluation [14,15].

A prospective, randomized-controlled trial is needed\nto fully understand optimal imaging procedures, particularly among patients receiving\nCRT + durvalumab [24].\nAs a result of the limited evidence informing optimal follow-up practices, recommen-\ndations for patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC who have undergone curative-intent\ntherapy vary across published guidelines, including those available in Canada [6,8,9,14,15,25].\nOne of the most recent and referenced recommendations, the 2020 American Society of\nClinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines, largely focuses on patients with resected stage I\u2013III\nNSCLC, a population with a very different relapse risk and salvage therapy options than\npatients with stage III unresectable disease who have received CRT [14,26,27]. Furthermore,\nthese guidelines do not yet consider the long-term survival \ufb01ndings for durvalumab in the\nPACIFIC trial [13].

Materials and Methods\nIn January 2022, a pan-Canadian multidisciplinary expert working group was formed\nthat included nine individuals: six medical oncologists (S.B., N.B., J.J.K., B.M., S.S., P.W.P.),\ntwo radiation oncologists (A.B., D.S.), and a family physician (C.C.). The experts were\nchosen to be geographically representative (i.e., from western Canada, Ontario, and eastern\nCanada), experts in medical or radiation oncology treatment in NSCLC, and/or experts\nin the provision of follow-up care in the community care setting. The number of experts\nwas considered appropriate, as the literature indicates that inclusion of a minimum of\n5 and a maximum of 12 experts falls within a reasonable range to assess consensus [29].\nThe designees of the consultation were J.J.K. and B.M. After development of the key\nrecommendations, a radiologist (R.Y.) was consulted to provide speci\ufb01c guidance regarding\nimaging modalities, body regions for scanning, and available supporting evidence.\nThe expert working group initially convened virtually via videoconference in January\n2022 to discuss \ufb01ve preliminary clinical questions related to the imaging of patients with\nstage III unresectable NSCLC after curative-intent treatment with CRT and considering\nuse of durvalumab as consolidation therapy. The clinical questions were derived from the\n\ufb01ndings of the 2021 BC Cancer Lung Group regional survey. The group discussed each\nquestion while considering the wording of the proposed BC Lung Cancer Management\nManual [30], published evidence, and their own clinical practice experience. Comments on\nthe wording of the questions, initial recommendations and their underlying rationale, and\nadditional feedback were documented in a summary report. Using the discussion from the\nmeeting, a re\ufb01ned set of clinical questions and formal recommendations were prepared for\nreview and voting. The updated questions included the following:\n(1)\nWhat timepoint should be used as a reference for initiation of imaging?\n(2)\nWhat is the recommended frequency of imaging?\n(3)\nWhat type of imaging should be used and which body regions should be assessed?\n(4)\nWho should follow the patient?\n(5)\nWhat other assessments or activities should be conducted?"}}, "f880d419-f94f-44d6-a32d-5bac137c543f": {"node_ids": ["5cc4c38e-d585-444c-ba1e-b379326ac34b"], "metadata": {"page_number": 3, "doc_title": "Follow-Up Imaging Guidelines for Patients with Stage III Unresectable NSCLC: Recommendations Based on the PACIFIC Trial", "keywords": ["patient history", "physical examination", "regular intervals", "cancer monitoring", "NSCLC", "CRT", "durvalumab"], "information_category": "Cancer surveillance and other recommended tests for cancer monitoring", "source": "(4)\nWho should follow the patient?\n(5)\nWhat other assessments or activities should be conducted?\nIn February 2022, the updated clinical questions and formal recommendations were\nprovided to the expert working group via an online survey (Microsoft Forms, Microsoft Cor-\nporation, Washington, DC, USA) for review, voting, and provision of additional comments\nand considerations.

In the PACIFIC trial, rates of progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) were 55.7% with CRT + durvalumab and 34.5% with CRT alone at one year\nof follow-up, 45.0% and 25.1% at two years, 39.7% and 20.8% at three years, 35.0% and\n19.9% at four years, and 33.1% and 19.0% at \ufb01ve years (Figure 1) [13].

As stated in the ASCO\nguidelines, not all patients are amenable to imaging: some may be unwilling to proceed\nwith subsequent therapy in the event that disease progression is identi\ufb01ed, while others\nmay not be clinical candidates for such treatment [14]. Regular imaging of these patients is\nunlikely to inform subsequent care and therefore may not be required. As stated by ASCO,\nage and PS should not preclude follow-up imaging, although discussion of the potential\nbene\ufb01ts and risks with patients is recommended [14].\nCLINICAL QUESTION 2: What is the recommended frequency of imaging?\nRecommendation 2.1: In Year 1 after CRT, all patients should undergo imaging every\n3 months.\nRecommendation 2.2: In Year 2, all patients should undergo imaging at least every\n6 months.\nRecommendation 2.3: In Years 3, 4, and 5, all patients should undergo imaging at\nleast every 12 months.\nClinical Rationale: In the PACIFIC trial, tumor assessment scans (CT or MRI; RECIST 1.1)\noccurred at screening and then every two months in Year 1 or until disease progression [33].\nAmong patients with disease control after completion of durvalumab, imaging assessments\nwere performed every three months until progressive disease was con\ufb01rmed.

This recommendation was based on the challenges\nencountered in distinguishing the etiology of pneumonitis as being related to radiation or\nimmunotherapy [49]. At 14.5 months of follow-up in the PACIFIC trial, pneumonitis or\nradiation pneumonitis of any grade and cause was reported in 33.9% of durvalumab-treated\npatients; grade 3 events occurred in 3.4% [10].

Furthermore, the comprehensive care of these individuals\nshould address both cancer-related and general care needs. These needs include not only\nongoing surveillance for disease recurrence or progression, but also monitoring and man-\nagement of psychosocial issues and chronic medical conditions, general health promotion,\nand disease prevention [14].
